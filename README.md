## AI Teaching Tools

There are currently 3 tools in the AI Teaching tools platform.

1. **Viz Builder** - Allows you (or your students) to build live, interactive visualizations using LLM prompting.
2. **Course Creator** - A robust tool for generating complete online curriculums using a LLM.
3. **App Monitor** - A tool to monitor your streamlit apps (e.g. Viz Builder and Course Creator, etc.)

### Preconfiguration

There are a couple of APIs that you can sign up for if you want commercial level LLMs (and also for Google Searching for Web Researcher (required)).

- [Recommended: Setup and Possibly Fund Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
  - Record the API key
- [Optional: Setup and Fund an Anthropic Account](https://console.anthropic.com/login?returnTo=%2F%3F)
  - Record the API key
- [Optional: Setup and Fund OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - Record the API key

### Installation

0. [Install git version control software](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. [Install anaconda for virtual python environments](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Download (or clone) the repository.

```bash
md ai_tools
cd ai_tools
git clone https://github.com/smutchle/ai_teaching_tools
```

3. Create your anaconda environment:

```bash
conda create --name ai_teaching python=3.10
conda activate ai_teaching
```

4. Install the required libraries:

```bash
cd ai_teaching_tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. In each folder, rename .env_sample to .env. Edit each .env file and put in your API key values, etc.
6. Run the appropriate .sh (Linux/Mac) or .bat (Windows) file in the **appropriate sub-directory**. This will launch the respective web interface. If there is no .bat file, you can simply rename the .sh file to .bat.

Linux/Mac:

```bash
cd course_creator
./run.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
cd course_creator
run.bat
```
