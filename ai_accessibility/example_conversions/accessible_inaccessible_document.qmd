## Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues. More information can be found [NASA climate resources](https://climate.nasa.gov).

### Background

The temperature has increased by <span style="color:red;"><strong>1.5°C</strong></span> since pre-industrial times.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Global temperature trends show a steady increase from 14.5°C in 2010 to 16.1°C in 2020, with a minor decline in 2015."
#| fig-alt: "Line chart showing global temperature trends from 2010 to 2020, with temperature in degrees Celsius on the y-axis ranging from approximately 14.5 to 16.1 degrees. The red line with black points demonstrates a general upward trend in temperatures over the decade, rising from 14.5°C in 2010 to 16.1°C in 2020, with minor fluctuations including a slight dip in 2014."
library(ggplot2)

# Create temperature plot
temp_data <- data.frame(
  year = 2010:2020,
  temp = c(14.5, 14.7, 14.9, 15.1, 15.0, 15.2, 15.4, 15.6, 15.8, 16.0, 16.1)
)

ggplot(temp_data, aes(x = year, y = temp)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Data Analysis

Below is the data from our study:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Annual trends in two measured variables across three time points from 2010 to 2020."
library(knitr)

data <- data.frame(
  c(2010, 2015, 2020),
  c(14.5, 15.2, 16.1),
  c(350, 380, 410)
)

kable(data)
```

The equation for temperature change is:

$$T(t) = T_0 + \alpha t$$

<span style="color:blue;"><strong>Important finding:</strong></span> The rate of change has accelerated.

### Statistical Analysis

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot showing a positive linear relationship between two normally distributed variables with a fitted regression line and confidence interval."
#| fig-alt: "A scatter plot showing a positive linear relationship between two variables (x and y), with 100 data points displayed as semi-transparent dots and a blue linear regression line with a confidence interval band overlaid on the data."

# Create correlation plot
set.seed(123)
cor_data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)
cor_data$y <- cor_data$y + 0.7 * cor_data$x

ggplot(cor_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

Immediate action is required. See section 3.2 above for more details.
