# Overview

This dataset explores the fascinating intersection of personality, demographics, and digital engagement in shaping our social connections. By analyzing factors such as personality traits, age, occupation, urbanization level, and digital literacy, we can predict the size of an individual's meaningful social network—a crucial indicator of social well-being and community integration in our increasingly connected world.

# Background and Use Case

Dr. Sarah Chen, a sociologist at Metropolitan University, is investigating how the digital revolution has transformed social relationship patterns across different demographic groups. Her research team has been commissioned by the City Planning Department to understand social connectivity patterns as part of a broader initiative to design more community-oriented urban spaces and digital inclusion programs.

The research addresses a critical question: In an era where social media promises unlimited connections, what factors truly determine the number of meaningful relationships people maintain? This information is vital for urban planners designing community spaces, social workers identifying at-risk populations, and policymakers developing digital literacy programs. Understanding these patterns can help communities foster stronger social bonds and identify individuals who might benefit from targeted social support interventions.

The study becomes particularly relevant as cities grapple with social isolation issues, especially following recent global events that have reshaped how we connect with others. By predicting social network sizes based on readily observable characteristics, community organizations can proactively reach out to individuals who might be socially isolated.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of meaningful social connections an individual maintains based on their personality characteristics, demographic information, and digital engagement patterns. This regression problem aims to identify the key factors that contribute to robust social networks and help communities better support social connectivity.

# Target Variable

**Social Network Size**: This variable represents the number of meaningful social relationships an individual actively maintains, including family members, close friends, colleagues with whom they have personal relationships, and community connections that involve regular interaction and mutual support. Unlike superficial social media connections, this measure focuses on relationships that provide emotional support, practical assistance, or regular meaningful interaction. Predicting social network size is valuable for identifying individuals at risk of social isolation, understanding community cohesion patterns, and designing interventions to strengthen social bonds within communities.

# Predictor Variables

- **Personality Traits**: Measured using established psychological scales capturing dimensions such as extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience. These traits fundamentally influence how individuals approach social interactions and relationship building.

- **Age**: Chronological age in years, which affects social network patterns due to life stage factors, generational differences in communication preferences, and varying social opportunities across the lifespan.

- **Occupation**: Employment category that influences social network size through workplace interactions, professional networking opportunities, and the social nature of different job types (e.g., teachers vs. remote software developers).

- **Urbanization Level**: A measure of how urban or rural an individual's living environment is, affecting access to social opportunities, community density, and the nature of social interactions available in their area.

- **Digital Literacy**: An individual's comfort and skill level with digital technologies and online communication platforms, which increasingly mediate social connections and can either enhance or limit social network development depending on proficiency and access.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds064_sociology_social_network_size.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations
- **Dirty Version** (`ds064_sociology_social_network_size_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues commonly encountered in social science research

# Suggested Approaches

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Start with this interpretable approach to understand the linear relationships between predictors and social network size, making it easy to communicate findings to policymakers and community organizations.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables (e.g., how age and digital literacy might interact differently across urban vs. rural settings) while maintaining reasonable interpretability through feature importance measures.

- **Gradient Boosting Models**: Achieve high predictive accuracy for identifying individuals who might benefit from social support interventions, with techniques like SHAP values helping explain individual predictions to social workers and community organizers.
