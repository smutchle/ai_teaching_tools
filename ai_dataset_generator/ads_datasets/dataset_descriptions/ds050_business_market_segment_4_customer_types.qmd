# Background and Use Case

RetailMax, a mid-sized omnichannel retailer, has been experiencing declining customer engagement and suboptimal marketing campaign performance. With over 10,000 active customers across multiple touchpoints—including physical stores, e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, and social media—the company struggles to deliver personalized experiences that resonate with different customer groups.

The marketing team has been using broad, one-size-fits-all campaigns that yield inconsistent results. Customer acquisition costs have increased by 35% over the past two years, while customer lifetime value has remained stagnant. The executive team recognizes that understanding their customer base through data-driven segmentation is crucial for optimizing marketing spend, improving customer satisfaction, and driving sustainable growth.

By implementing a sophisticated customer segmentation model, RetailMax aims to identify distinct customer personas that will inform targeted marketing strategies, personalized product recommendations, optimal channel selection, and customized customer experiences. This segmentation will enable the company to allocate marketing budgets more effectively and develop products that better serve each customer group's unique needs and preferences.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to accurately classify customers into one of four distinct market segments based on their behavioral patterns, demographic characteristics, psychological traits, and channel preferences. This classification will enable targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences that drive engagement and revenue growth.

# Target Variable

**Market Segment (4 customer types)**: This categorical variable represents four distinct customer segments that have been identified through business analysis:

1. **Premium Loyalists**: High-value customers who prefer quality over price and show strong brand loyalty
2. **Value Seekers**: Price-conscious customers who actively seek discounts and compare prices across channels
3. **Digital Natives**: Tech-savvy customers who prefer online shopping and digital interactions
4. **Traditional Shoppers**: Customers who prefer in-store experiences and established shopping patterns

Understanding which segment a customer belongs to is crucial for tailoring marketing messages, selecting appropriate communication channels, optimizing product recommendations, and determining pricing strategies that maximize both customer satisfaction and business profitability.

# Predictor Variables

## Purchase Patterns
- **Average Order Value**: Historical spending per transaction
- **Purchase Frequency**: Number of purchases within specific time periods
- **Seasonal Spending Patterns**: Variations in spending across different seasons
- **Product Category Preferences**: Types of products most frequently purchased
- **Price Sensitivity**: Response to discounts and promotional offers

## Demographics
- **Age Group**: Customer age ranges affecting purchasing behavior
- **Income Level**: Household income brackets influencing spending capacity
- **Geographic Location**: Regional factors affecting shopping preferences
- **Household Size**: Family composition impacting purchase decisions
- **Education Level**: Educational background correlating with product preferences

## Psychographics
- **Lifestyle Preferences**: Values and interests that drive purchasing decisions
- **Brand Consciousness**: Importance placed on brand reputation and prestige
- **Innovation Adoption**: Willingness to try new products and technologies
- **Environmental Consciousness**: Preference for sustainable and eco-friendly products
- **Social Influence**: Susceptibility to peer recommendations and social proof

## Channel Preference
- **Primary Shopping Channel**: Preferred method of making purchases (online, in-store, mobile)
- **Information Seeking Behavior**: How customers research products before buying
- **Customer Service Preferences**: Preferred methods for support and communication
- **Digital Engagement Level**: Activity across digital touchpoints and social media

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds050_business_market_segment_4_customer_types.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with no missing values or data quality issues
- **Dirty Version** (`ds050_business_market_segment_4_customer_types_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality challenges that require preprocessing and cleaning techniques

# Suggested Approaches

## Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble method that handles mixed data types well and provides feature importance rankings to understand which customer characteristics are most predictive of segment membership.

## Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
Advanced boosting algorithms that often achieve superior performance on structured data and can capture complex interactions between customer attributes.

## Logistic Regression with Feature Engineering
A interpretable baseline approach that, when combined with proper feature engineering and regularization, can provide clear insights into how different customer characteristics influence segment classification.
