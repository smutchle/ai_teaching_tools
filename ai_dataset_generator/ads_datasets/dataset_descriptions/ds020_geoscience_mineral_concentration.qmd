# Background and Use Case

Imagine you're working as a data scientist for Northern Geological Services, a consulting company that specializes in mineral exploration for mining companies. Your client, Aurora Mining Corporation, has been conducting exploratory drilling across a promising mineral belt in northern Canada. They've collected extensive geological data from 500,000 drill core samples across multiple sites, but laboratory analysis for precise mineral concentration is expensive and time-consuming, costing approximately $200 per sample and taking 2-3 weeks for results.

Aurora Mining needs to make rapid decisions about which areas warrant further investment and detailed analysis. They've commissioned your team to develop a predictive model that can estimate mineral concentration based on readily available geological measurements. This model would allow them to prioritize high-potential areas for expensive laboratory analysis, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in exploration costs while accelerating their discovery timeline.

The economic implications are significant: accurate predictions could help identify ore bodies with concentrations above the economic threshold (typically 2-3% for this type of deposit), while avoiding costly development of sub-economic deposits. In the competitive mining industry, the ability to rapidly assess mineral potential can mean the difference between securing a profitable mining lease and losing out to competitors.

# Problem Statement

Given geological and environmental measurements from drill core samples, predict the mineral concentration percentage to guide exploration decisions and optimize resource allocation in mineral exploration programs.

# Target Variable

**Mineral Concentration**: The percentage of valuable minerals present in rock samples, measured as a continuous variable ranging from 0% to approximately 15%. This represents the ore grade, which directly determines the economic viability of extraction. Concentrations above 2-3% are typically considered economically viable for mining operations, while concentrations below 1% are generally sub-economic. Accurate prediction of this variable enables mining companies to:

- Prioritize areas for detailed geological surveys
- Estimate potential revenue from mineral deposits
- Make informed decisions about land acquisition and drilling programs
- Optimize resource allocation in exploration budgets
- Assess project feasibility before major capital investments

# Predictor Variables

- **Rock Type**: Categorical variable indicating the geological formation (e.g., granite, schist, quartzite, volcanic). Different rock types have varying potential for hosting mineral deposits based on their formation processes and chemical composition.

- **Depth**: Measurement in meters below surface, ranging from shallow surface samples to deep drill cores. Depth affects mineral concentration due to geological processes like hydrothermal alteration and weathering effects.

- **Temperature**: Subsurface temperature in degrees Celsius, influenced by geothermal gradient and depth. Temperature affects mineral formation processes and can indicate proximity to mineralizing systems.

- **Pressure**: Geological pressure in kilopascals, related to depth and local geological conditions. Pressure influences mineral crystallization and can indicate structural controls on mineralization.

- **Weathering Index**: A composite score (0-100) measuring the degree of rock alteration due to chemical and physical weathering processes. Weathering can both concentrate and deplete minerals depending on their chemical stability.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions to support different learning objectives:

- **Clean Version** (`ds020_geoscience_mineral_concentration.csv`): Perfect for initial model development and learning core regression techniques without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds020_geoscience_mineral_concentration_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world geological data where equipment malfunctions, measurement errors, and extreme geological conditions create data quality challenges

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to understand baseline relationships between geological variables and mineral concentration, providing interpretable coefficients for geological insights.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between geological variables, while providing feature importance rankings to identify key geological controls.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Advanced ensemble methods that can model complex geological relationships and often achieve high accuracy in mineral prediction tasks, particularly useful for optimizing economic thresholds.
