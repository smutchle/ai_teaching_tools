# Background and Use Case

TechFlow Solutions, a mid-sized software consulting company, has been experiencing varying levels of productivity across its workforce. With the rise of remote work and changing team dynamics post-2020, the HR department wants to understand what factors most significantly impact employee output. The company tracks individual productivity through a comprehensive scoring system that combines project completion rates, code quality metrics, client satisfaction scores, and peer collaboration ratings.

The company's Chief People Officer has initiated a data-driven approach to workforce optimization. By understanding the relationship between employee characteristics, work arrangements, and productivity outcomes, TechFlow aims to make informed decisions about hiring, training investments, team composition, and flexible work policies. This analysis could help them identify high-potential employees, optimize training budgets, and design work arrangements that maximize both employee satisfaction and business outcomes.

The insights from this analysis will directly inform strategic decisions about remote work policies, team size optimization, training program investments, and performance management systems across the organization.

# Problem Statement

**Objective**: Predict employee productivity scores based on individual characteristics and work arrangements to optimize workforce management and resource allocation decisions.

This regression problem involves quantifying the complex relationship between employee attributes and their measured productivity, enabling data-driven human resources strategies.

# Target Variable

**Employee Productivity Score**: A composite metric ranging from 0-100 that quantifies individual employee output and efficiency. This score combines multiple performance indicators including:

- Project completion rate and timeline adherence
- Quality of work output (code reviews, deliverable standards)
- Client satisfaction ratings for employee contributions  
- Collaboration effectiveness and team contribution metrics
- Innovation and problem-solving contributions

This metric is valuable to predict because it enables proactive workforce management, helps identify factors that drive high performance, and supports evidence-based decisions about team composition, training investments, and work arrangement policies.

# Predictor Variables

- **Years Experience**: Total years of professional experience in the field (0-20 years). More experienced employees typically bring deeper expertise and efficiency, but the relationship may be non-linear as very senior employees might focus more on mentoring than direct output.

- **Training Hours**: Annual hours invested in professional development and skill training (0-200 hours). Training investment should correlate with productivity as employees develop new skills and stay current with industry practices.

- **Team Size**: Number of people in the employee's primary project team (2-15 members). Team size affects collaboration dynamics, communication overhead, and individual accountability, with potential optimal ranges for different types of work.

- **Work-from-Home Days**: Average number of days per week working remotely (0-5 days). Remote work arrangements can impact productivity through factors like reduced commute stress, fewer office distractions, but also potential isolation and communication challenges.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds002_business_employee_productivity_score.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core regression concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds002_business_employee_productivity_score_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete HR records, data entry errors, and exceptional cases

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to understand baseline relationships and feature importance, providing interpretable coefficients for business stakeholders

- **Random Forest Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions (e.g., how training effectiveness might vary by experience level), while providing feature importance rankings

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Achieve high predictive accuracy and handle complex patterns, particularly useful for identifying optimal ranges for team size and work-from-home arrangements
