format: html
---

# Overview

This dataset examines the complex dynamics of social mobility by tracking economic advancement across generations. Using key socioeconomic indicators including parental education levels, family income quintiles, neighborhood quality metrics, and access to educational and social resources, we can predict an individual's Social Mobility Score - a comprehensive measure of their economic advancement relative to their family background.

# Background and Use Case

The Department of Social Services in a major metropolitan area is developing a new early intervention program called "Pathways to Prosperity." This initiative aims to identify young adults (ages 18-25) who may face barriers to economic advancement despite having potential for upward mobility. By understanding the factors that most strongly predict social mobility outcomes, the department can allocate limited resources more effectively and design targeted interventions.

Currently, the department relies on basic income thresholds to determine program eligibility, but this approach often misses individuals who could benefit most from support. For example, a young person from a low-income family living in a well-resourced neighborhood with college-educated parents may have different mobility prospects than someone with similar current income but fewer structural advantages. The department has collected comprehensive data on program participants and their families over the past five years, tracking their economic progress.

The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess social mobility potential during the initial intake process, allowing caseworkers to provide personalized recommendations and connect individuals with the most appropriate resources, from job training programs to educational scholarships to housing assistance.

# Problem Statement

Given information about an individual's family background, neighborhood characteristics, and access to resources, predict their Social Mobility Score to identify those who would benefit most from targeted interventions and to understand which factors most strongly influence economic advancement across generations.

# Target Variable

**Social Mobility Score**: A composite measure ranging from 0 to 100 that quantifies an individual's economic advancement relative to their family's baseline socioeconomic status. The score incorporates multiple dimensions including income growth, educational attainment relative to parents, occupational prestige advancement, and wealth accumulation over a 5-year period. Higher scores indicate greater upward mobility, while lower scores may indicate economic stagnation or downward mobility. This metric is particularly valuable for policy makers and social workers because it captures not just absolute economic outcomes, but progress relative to starting conditions, making it a more equitable measure of success across different socioeconomic backgrounds.

# Predictor Variables

- **Parental Education**: Highest level of education achieved by either parent, measured on a scale from 1 (less than high school) to 6 (graduate degree). This variable captures the cultural and social capital that parents can transfer to their children, including knowledge of educational systems, professional networks, and academic expectations.

- **Income Quintile**: Family's income position relative to the broader population, ranging from 1 (bottom quintile, lowest 20% of earners) to 5 (top quintile, highest 20% of earners). This provides context for the family's economic resources and constraints during the individual's formative years.

- **Neighborhood Quality**: A composite index (0-10 scale) incorporating factors such as school quality ratings, crime statistics, employment opportunities, public transportation access, and availability of social services. Higher scores indicate more advantaged neighborhoods with better infrastructure and opportunities.

- **Access to Resources**: A score (0-10 scale) measuring the individual's access to mobility-enhancing resources including mentorship programs, internship opportunities, professional networks, financial assistance for education, and career guidance services. This variable captures both formal programs and informal social connections that can facilitate economic advancement.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds013_sociology_social_mobility_score.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations and no outliers
- **Dirty Version** (`ds013_sociology_social_mobility_score_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete survey responses, data entry errors, and extreme cases that may require special handling

# Suggested Approaches

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Start with this interpretable approach to understand the linear relationships between predictor variables and social mobility outcomes, making it easy to explain findings to policy makers and social workers.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions between variables (e.g., the effect of neighborhood quality may vary depending on parental education level), while providing feature importance rankings to guide intervention strategies.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Achieve high predictive accuracy for identifying individuals most likely to benefit from interventions, particularly useful when working with the dirty dataset version that contains missing values and outliers.

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes. The relationships between variables have been designed to be realistic and pedagogically useful while maintaining interpretability. The data reflects general patterns observed in social mobility research while avoiding reproduction of sensitive personal information. Students can use this dataset to explore important questions about equality of opportunity and the effectiveness of social interventions without privacy concerns.
