title: "Dataset 1: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction for E-commerce Analytics"
format: html
---

# Overview

This dataset enables students to explore customer lifetime value (CLV) prediction, one of the most critical metrics in modern business analytics. Using realistic customer transaction data from an e-commerce platform, learners can build regression models to predict the total revenue a customer will generate throughout their relationship with the company. This foundational business problem demonstrates how data science directly impacts strategic decision-making in customer relationship management and marketing optimization.

# Background and Use Case

**TechStyle Marketplace** is a mid-sized e-commerce platform specializing in fashion and lifestyle products. With over 50,000 active customers and growing competition from major retailers, the company's marketing team faces increasing pressure to optimize their customer acquisition and retention strategies. Traditional marketing approaches of treating all customers equally have proven inefficient, leading to wasted marketing spend and missed opportunities for high-value customer development.

The company's Chief Marketing Officer has initiated a data-driven transformation, recognizing that understanding customer lifetime value is crucial for sustainable growth. By accurately predicting CLV, TechStyle can make informed decisions about customer acquisition costs, personalize marketing campaigns, identify at-risk high-value customers, and allocate resources more effectively across different customer segments.

The analytics team has compiled historical customer data spanning two years of transactions, capturing key behavioral patterns and engagement metrics. This dataset represents a typical business intelligence challenge where predictive modeling can directly translate into actionable business strategies and improved profitability.

# Problem Statement

Develop a regression model to predict Customer Lifetime Value based on historical customer behavior patterns. The model should help TechStyle Marketplace identify high-value customers early in their journey and optimize marketing investments by understanding which customer characteristics drive long-term revenue generation.

# Target Variable

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: The total monetary value (in USD) that a customer is predicted to generate throughout their entire relationship with the company. This metric encompasses all past and projected future purchases, making it essential for strategic business planning. CLV prediction enables companies to:

- Set appropriate customer acquisition budgets
- Identify customers worth investing in for retention campaigns  
- Segment customers for personalized marketing approaches
- Optimize pricing and product recommendations
- Make data-driven decisions about customer service investments

Understanding CLV helps businesses shift from short-term transaction thinking to long-term relationship building, ultimately driving sustainable revenue growth.

# Predictor Variables

- **Purchase Frequency**: The average number of purchases made by the customer per month. Higher frequency typically indicates stronger engagement and loyalty, making it a strong predictor of future value.

- **Average Transaction Value**: The mean dollar amount spent per transaction. This metric captures the customer's spending power and preferences for higher or lower-priced items.

- **Tenure**: The length of the customer relationship measured in months since first purchase. Longer tenure often correlates with higher lifetime value and indicates customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- **Product Categories**: The number of distinct product categories the customer has purchased from (e.g., clothing, accessories, shoes, home goods). Cross-category purchasing behavior often indicates deeper engagement with the brand and higher retention likelihood.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions to support different learning objectives:

- **Clean Version** (`ds001_business_customer_lifetime_value.csv`): Contains complete data with no missing values or extreme outliers. Ideal for initial model development, algorithm comparison, and learning fundamental regression techniques without data quality complications.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds001_business_customer_lifetime_value_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality challenges. Perfect for practicing data cleaning, outlier detection, imputation strategies, and robust modeling techniques that students will encounter in professional settings.

# Suggested Approaches

**Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to establish baseline performance and understand feature relationships. This interpretable approach helps students grasp how each predictor variable influences CLV and provides clear coefficients for business stakeholders.

**Random Forest**: Implement ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Random forests are particularly effective for business datasets as they handle mixed data types well and provide feature importance rankings that support business decision-making.

**Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Advanced students can explore boosting algorithms for potentially superior predictive performance. These methods often excel in business applications and provide opportunities to learn hyperparameter tuning and model optimization techniques.
