# Overview

This dataset contains ecological measurements from 500,000 habitat sites across diverse ecosystems, designed to predict habitat quality based on key environmental indicators. Students will work with real-world ecological concepts to build classification models that can assess ecosystem health - a critical tool for conservation planning and environmental management.

# Background and Use Case

The Pacific Northwest Conservation Alliance is developing an automated habitat assessment system to prioritize conservation efforts across thousands of potential sites. Traditional habitat quality assessments require expensive field surveys by expert ecologists, limiting the organization's ability to evaluate large areas efficiently. The alliance has collected comprehensive data from 500,000 previously surveyed sites, where expert ecologists have classified habitat quality into four categories.

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict habitat quality using readily measurable ecological indicators. This would allow the alliance to quickly screen potential conservation sites, focusing their limited expert resources on the most promising locations. The model would also help identify which ecological factors are most critical for habitat quality, informing future conservation strategies.

Such predictive models are increasingly important as climate change and human development pressure ecosystems worldwide. Rapid, accurate habitat assessment tools enable conservationists to make data-driven decisions about where to invest limited conservation resources for maximum ecological impact.

# Problem Statement

Given ecological measurements from a habitat site, predict the overall habitat quality category (Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent). This multi-class classification problem requires understanding the complex relationships between species diversity, vegetation condition, human disturbance, and landscape connectivity.

# Target Variable

**Habitat Quality (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent)**: A categorical assessment of overall ecosystem health and conservation value, determined by expert ecologists using standardized protocols. 

- **Poor**: Severely degraded habitats with limited biodiversity and high disturbance
- **Fair**: Moderately impacted habitats with some conservation value but significant limitations  
- **Good**: Well-functioning ecosystems with high biodiversity and minimal disturbance
- **Excellent**: Pristine or near-pristine habitats representing the highest conservation priority

This classification directly informs conservation decisions, with "Good" and "Excellent" sites typically prioritized for protection, while "Poor" and "Fair" sites may be candidates for restoration efforts.

# Predictor Variables

- **Species Richness**: Total number of species observed at the site (integer count). Higher species richness generally indicates healthier, more stable ecosystems and is a key indicator of biodiversity conservation value.

- **Vegetation Health**: Composite score (0-100) measuring plant community condition, including factors like canopy cover, native species dominance, and absence of invasive species. Healthy vegetation provides habitat structure and resources for wildlife.

- **Disturbance Level**: Quantified measure (0-100) of human and natural disturbances including development, pollution, fragmentation, and recent natural disasters. Lower disturbance levels typically correlate with higher habitat quality.

- **Connectivity**: Index (0-100) measuring how well the habitat is connected to other natural areas through corridors and proximity. Well-connected habitats support larger, more viable wildlife populations and facilitate species movement.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds034_ecology_habitat_quality_poorfairgoodexcellent.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core classification concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds034_ecology_habitat_quality_poorfairgoodexcellent_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data collection challenges like equipment failures, measurement errors, and incomplete surveys

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships between ecological variables and handling mixed data types. Provides interpretable feature importance rankings to identify key habitat indicators.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Often achieves high accuracy on ecological classification problems by learning complex interactions between environmental factors.

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Takes advantage of the natural ordering in habitat quality categories (Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent), potentially improving prediction accuracy and interpretability.
