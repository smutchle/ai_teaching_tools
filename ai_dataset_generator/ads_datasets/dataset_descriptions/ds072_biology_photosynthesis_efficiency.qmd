# Background and Use Case

Climate change and increasing global food demand have made understanding plant productivity more critical than ever. Agricultural researchers at the International Center for Plant Physiology are developing predictive models to optimize greenhouse growing conditions for maximum crop yield. Their goal is to create automated environmental control systems that can adjust lighting, CO2 levels, temperature, and irrigation in real-time based on plant physiological responses.

The research team has been collecting photosynthesis efficiency data from various plant species under different environmental conditions. By understanding how factors like light wavelength, atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature, water availability, and plant maturity affect photosynthetic performance, they can develop precision agriculture systems that maximize carbon fixation rates while minimizing resource consumption.

This work has implications beyond agriculture - from reforestation efforts that need to optimize tree planting strategies, to space exploration missions planning sustainable food production systems for long-term space habitation. Understanding and predicting photosynthesis efficiency is fundamental to addressing some of humanity's greatest challenges.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to predict the photosynthesis efficiency of plants based on five key environmental and biological factors. This regression problem aims to quantify the carbon fixation rate per unit leaf area, enabling researchers to optimize growing conditions and predict plant productivity under various scenarios.

# Target Variable

**Photosynthesis Efficiency**: Measured as micromoles of CO2 fixed per square meter of leaf area per second (μmol CO2 m⁻² s⁻¹). This metric represents how effectively a plant converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic compounds through photosynthesis. Higher values indicate more efficient carbon fixation, which directly correlates with plant growth rate, biomass accumulation, and ultimately crop yield. Predicting this variable allows researchers to optimize environmental conditions for maximum plant productivity and helps farmers make informed decisions about resource allocation.

# Predictor Variables

- **Light Wavelength (nm)**: The dominant wavelength of light provided to the plant, ranging from blue (400nm) to red (700nm). Different wavelengths are absorbed with varying efficiency by chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments, directly affecting photosynthetic rate.

- **CO2 Concentration (ppm)**: Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration around the plant. CO2 is the primary carbon source for photosynthesis, and its availability often limits photosynthetic rate, especially under high light conditions.

- **Temperature (°C)**: Ambient temperature affects enzyme activity in photosynthetic reactions. The temperature-dependent enzymes involved in carbon fixation have optimal operating ranges, with efficiency dropping at both extremes.

- **Water Stress Level (0-1 scale)**: A normalized measure of plant water deficit, where 0 represents well-watered conditions and 1 represents severe drought stress. Water stress affects stomatal conductance, limiting CO2 uptake and reducing photosynthetic efficiency.

- **Leaf Age (days)**: The age of the measured leaf tissue since emergence. Younger leaves typically have higher photosynthetic capacity due to higher chlorophyll content and more efficient cellular machinery, while older leaves show declining efficiency.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds072_biology_photosynthesis_efficiency.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental regression techniques without the complexity of data quality issues.
- **Dirty Version** (`ds072_biology_photosynthesis_efficiency_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as sensor malfunctions, measurement errors, or extreme environmental conditions.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships between environmental factors and photosynthetic response, while providing feature importance rankings to identify the most influential variables.

- **Polynomial Regression**: Useful for modeling the known curvilinear relationships in photosynthesis, such as light saturation curves and temperature response functions that follow biological optimization patterns.

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Effective for handling the complex, multi-dimensional interactions between environmental variables, particularly when combined with RBF kernels to capture non-linear biological responses.
