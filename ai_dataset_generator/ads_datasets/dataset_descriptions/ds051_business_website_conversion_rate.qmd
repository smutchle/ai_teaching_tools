# Background and Use Case

**TechStart Solutions**, a growing e-commerce platform specializing in productivity software, has been experiencing inconsistent conversion rates across their product landing pages. Despite driving significant traffic through digital marketing campaigns, the company noticed that conversion rates varied dramatically between different pages and user segments, ranging from as low as 1.2% to as high as 8.5%.

The marketing team, led by Sarah Chen, suspects that technical performance issues and design inconsistencies are preventing potential customers from completing purchases. With monthly marketing spend exceeding $50,000, even small improvements in conversion rates could translate to substantial revenue increases. The company has collected data from their analytics platform, combining technical performance metrics with user experience scores to understand what drives successful conversions.

Sarah's team needs a predictive model that can identify which combination of factors leads to optimal conversion rates. This model would help them prioritize website improvements, allocate development resources effectively, and provide data-driven recommendations for new landing page designs.

# Problem Statement

Develop a regression model to predict website conversion rates based on technical performance and user experience factors. The model should help identify which improvements would have the greatest impact on converting visitors into customers.

# Target Variable

**Website Conversion Rate**: The percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action (such as making a purchase, signing up for a trial, or downloading a resource) during their visit. This metric is crucial for businesses as it directly correlates with revenue generation and return on marketing investment. Conversion rates typically range from 1% to 10% for most e-commerce sites, with even small improvements (0.5-1%) potentially resulting in significant revenue increases when scaled across thousands of monthly visitors.

# Predictor Variables

- **Page Load Time**: The time (in seconds) it takes for a webpage to fully load and become interactive. Research shows that pages loading in under 2 seconds have optimal conversion rates, while each additional second can reduce conversions by 7-10%. This metric directly impacts user experience and search engine rankings.

- **Mobile Responsiveness Score**: A composite score (0-100) measuring how well the website adapts to mobile devices, including touch-friendly navigation, readable text without zooming, and appropriate button sizes. With mobile traffic often exceeding 60% of total visits, this factor significantly impacts conversion potential.

- **Call-to-Action Clarity**: A scored assessment (1-10) of how clear, prominent, and compelling the primary call-to-action elements are on the page. This includes button visibility, text clarity, placement, and color contrast. Higher scores indicate more obvious and persuasive action prompts.

- **Trust Signals**: A composite score (0-100) measuring the presence and quality of trust-building elements such as security badges, customer testimonials, money-back guarantees, contact information visibility, and professional design quality. Trust signals are particularly important for new visitors and high-value transactions.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds051_business_website_conversion_rate.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data and no anomalies
- **Dirty Version** (`ds051_business_website_conversion_rate_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete analytics tracking or measurement errors

# Suggested Approaches

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Start with this interpretable baseline to understand the linear relationships between each predictor and conversion rate, providing clear business insights about which factors have the strongest impact.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables (e.g., mobile responsiveness might be more important when page load time is slow), while providing feature importance rankings.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Achieve potentially higher predictive accuracy by modeling complex interactions, particularly useful for identifying optimal combinations of improvements that maximize conversion rates.
