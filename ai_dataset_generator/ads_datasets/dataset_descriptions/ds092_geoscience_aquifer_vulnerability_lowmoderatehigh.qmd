# Overview

This dataset focuses on assessing aquifer vulnerability to contamination, a critical challenge in environmental geoscience and water resource management. The dataset contains hydrogeological and environmental measurements from 500,000 monitoring sites, with the goal of classifying each location's groundwater contamination risk as Low, Moderate, or High vulnerability. This classification problem is essential for environmental protection, urban planning, and sustainable water resource management.

# Background and Use Case

The Regional Water Authority of the Colorado River Basin has identified groundwater contamination as an emerging threat to municipal water supplies. With increasing agricultural activities, urban development, and industrial operations across the region, protecting aquifer systems has become a top priority. Traditional groundwater vulnerability assessments are time-intensive and expensive, requiring extensive field surveys and laboratory analyses that can take months to complete.

The Authority has collected comprehensive hydrogeological data from 500,000 monitoring wells across diverse geological settings, including agricultural lands, urban areas, and natural preserves. Each site has been classified by expert hydrogeologists based on comprehensive contamination risk assessments. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can rapidly assess aquifer vulnerability at new locations using readily available geological and environmental data.

This predictive capability would enable water resource managers to prioritize monitoring efforts, implement targeted protection measures, and make informed decisions about land use permits and industrial development. The model could also support emergency response planning by identifying areas where contamination events would pose the greatest risk to groundwater quality.

# Problem Statement

Develop a classification model to predict aquifer vulnerability levels (Low, Moderate, High) based on hydrogeological and environmental characteristics. The model should help water resource managers quickly identify areas at risk of groundwater contamination without requiring extensive field investigations.

# Target Variable

**Aquifer Vulnerability (Low/Moderate/High)**: This categorical variable represents the overall susceptibility of groundwater to contamination from surface activities. 

- **Low Vulnerability**: Deep water tables, low-permeability soils, and protective geological layers that significantly impede contaminant migration
- **Moderate Vulnerability**: Intermediate conditions where some natural protection exists but contamination could occur under certain circumstances
- **High Vulnerability**: Shallow groundwater, highly permeable soils, and geological conditions that provide minimal protection against surface contamination

This classification is crucial because it directly informs environmental protection strategies, land use planning decisions, and monitoring program priorities. Areas with high vulnerability require more stringent environmental controls and frequent monitoring, while low vulnerability areas may support more intensive land use activities with appropriate safeguards.

# Predictor Variables

- **Depth to Water (meters)**: The vertical distance from ground surface to the water table. Deeper water tables generally provide better protection against surface contamination as contaminants must travel farther through soil and rock layers.

- **Soil Permeability (cm/day)**: Measures how easily water and dissolved contaminants can move through soil layers. Higher permeability indicates faster contaminant transport and increased vulnerability.

- **Recharge Rate (mm/year)**: The annual rate at which precipitation and surface water infiltrate to replenish groundwater. Higher recharge rates can increase contaminant transport but also provide dilution effects.

- **Land Use**: Categorical variable describing surface activities (Agricultural, Urban, Industrial, Natural). Different land uses present varying contamination risks, from pesticide applications in agriculture to chemical spills in industrial areas.

- **Geology**: The dominant geological formation (Sandstone, Limestone, Shale, Alluvium). Different rock types have varying abilities to filter and attenuate contaminants, with fractured rock providing less protection than fine-grained sediments.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds092_geoscience_aquifer_vulnerability_lowmoderatehigh.csv`): Perfect for initial model development and learning fundamental classification techniques. Contains complete data with no missing values or measurement errors.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds092_geoscience_aquifer_vulnerability_lowmoderatehigh_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as equipment malfunctions, measurement errors, and incomplete field surveys. Ideal for practicing data cleaning and robust modeling techniques.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Classification**: Excellent for handling mixed data types (numerical and categorical) and capturing complex interactions between geological and environmental factors. Provides feature importance rankings to identify key vulnerability indicators.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Well-suited for this multi-class problem with potential non-linear relationships between hydrogeological variables. Often achieves high accuracy on environmental classification tasks.

- **Logistic Regression with Feature Engineering**: Provides interpretable results crucial for regulatory and policy applications. Consider polynomial features and interactions between geological and hydrological variables.

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes in environmental data science and hydrogeology courses. The relationships between variables have been designed to reflect realistic hydrogeological processes and environmental conditions while maintaining clear learning objectives. The dataset structure and variable relationships are based on established principles in groundwater vulnerability assessment methodologies such as DRASTIC and GOD frameworks used by environmental professionals worldwide.
