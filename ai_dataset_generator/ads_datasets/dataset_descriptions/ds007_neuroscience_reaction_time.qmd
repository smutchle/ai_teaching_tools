# Background and Use Case

Dr. Sarah Chen, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University Research Institute, is investigating how various factors influence reaction times in healthy adults. Her research team has been collecting data from participants who complete a standardized visual stimulus response task in their laboratory. Participants are presented with simple geometric shapes on a computer screen and must press a button as quickly as possible when they detect a specific target shape.

This research has important applications in understanding cognitive aging, optimizing human-computer interfaces, and developing assessment tools for neurological conditions. The laboratory has collected comprehensive data on participant characteristics and experimental conditions to build predictive models that could help identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline or optimize task designs for different populations.

The research team wants to develop a machine learning model that can predict reaction times based on easily measurable participant characteristics and experimental conditions. Such a model would be valuable for clinical screening, ergonomic design, and understanding the fundamental mechanisms of human information processing.

# Problem Statement

Given information about a participant's demographic characteristics, current state, and experimental conditions, can we accurately predict their reaction time to visual stimuli? This regression problem is crucial for advancing our understanding of cognitive processing and has practical applications in clinical assessment and interface design.

# Target Variable

**Reaction Time**: Measured in milliseconds, this represents the time elapsed between stimulus presentation and the participant's button press response. Reaction time is a fundamental measure in cognitive neuroscience that reflects the efficiency of information processing, from sensory detection through motor response execution. Predicting reaction times is valuable for identifying cognitive impairments, optimizing task difficulty, assessing the effects of interventions, and understanding individual differences in processing speed. Typical reaction times for simple visual tasks range from 200-600 milliseconds in healthy adults.

# Predictor Variables

- **Age**: Participant age in years (18-75). Age is one of the strongest predictors of reaction time, with processing speed typically declining after age 30 due to changes in neural efficiency and white matter integrity.

- **Fatigue Level**: Self-reported fatigue on a scale of 1-10, where 1 represents "completely alert" and 10 represents "extremely tired". Mental fatigue significantly impairs attention and processing speed.

- **Task Complexity**: Experimental manipulation ranging from 1 (simple detection) to 5 (complex discrimination). Higher complexity requires more cognitive processing, leading to slower responses.

- **Caffeine Intake**: Amount of caffeine consumed in the 4 hours prior to testing (in milligrams). Caffeine is a psychoactive stimulant that can improve alertness and reduce reaction times, particularly in fatigued individuals.

- **Prior Training**: Number of previous sessions the participant has completed (0-20). Practice effects can lead to faster and more consistent performance through procedural learning and reduced task-related anxiety.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds007_neuroscience_reaction_time.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core regression concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds007_neuroscience_reaction_time_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as equipment malfunctions, participant non-compliance, or data entry errors

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to understand the linear relationships between predictors and reaction time, providing interpretable coefficients for each factor.

- **Random Forest**: Use ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables (e.g., age-fatigue interactions, caffeine effects varying by training level).

- **Gradient Boosting**: Apply XGBoost or similar algorithms to achieve high predictive accuracy while handling the complex, potentially non-monotonic relationships between cognitive factors and performance.
