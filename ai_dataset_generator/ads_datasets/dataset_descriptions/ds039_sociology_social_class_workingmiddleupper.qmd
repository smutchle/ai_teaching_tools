# Overview

This dataset explores the complex dynamics of socioeconomic stratification in contemporary society, focusing on the classification of individuals into three primary social classes: Working, Middle, and Upper class. The dataset captures multiple dimensions of social positioning including economic resources, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and cultural capital, providing a comprehensive view of how social class manifests in modern society.

# Background and Use Case

The Metropolitan Social Research Institute has been commissioned by the Department of Social Policy to conduct a comprehensive study on social mobility and class structure in urban areas. As income inequality continues to rise and social mobility patterns shift, policymakers need evidence-based insights to design effective interventions and understand the changing nature of class boundaries.

Traditional measures of social class often rely solely on income or occupation, but contemporary sociological research recognizes that social stratification is multidimensional. Pierre Bourdieu's influential work highlighted how cultural capital—including education, cultural knowledge, and social connections—plays a crucial role alongside economic capital in determining social position. This study aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of class membership by incorporating these multiple dimensions.

The research team has collected data from 500,000 randomly selected adults across major metropolitan areas, gathering information on their occupation, education level, income, accumulated wealth, and various indicators of cultural capital. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into social classes, which will inform policy discussions about education funding, social services allocation, and economic development programs.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict an individual's social class based on their socioeconomic characteristics. This prediction task is valuable for understanding the relative importance of different factors in determining class membership and can help identify individuals who might benefit from targeted social programs or educational interventions.

# Target Variable

**Social Class (Working/Middle/Upper)**: This three-category classification represents an individual's position within the social stratification system. The **Working Class** typically includes individuals in manual labor, service jobs, or lower-skilled positions with limited economic security and fewer opportunities for advancement. The **Middle Class** encompasses professionals, managers, and skilled workers who have achieved economic stability, educational credentials, and moderate wealth accumulation. The **Upper Class** represents individuals with significant economic resources, high-status occupations, substantial wealth, and privileged access to cultural and social capital.

Understanding and predicting social class is crucial because class membership influences life outcomes including health, educational opportunities for children, political participation, and access to social networks. Accurate classification can help researchers and policymakers identify patterns of inequality and design targeted interventions to promote social mobility.

# Predictor Variables

- **Occupation**: Categorical variable representing job type and occupational prestige, ranging from manual labor and service positions to professional and executive roles. Occupation serves as a key indicator of social status and economic position.

- **Education**: Ordinal variable capturing highest educational attainment, from less than high school through advanced degrees. Education represents both human capital and cultural capital, influencing earning potential and social connections.

- **Income**: Continuous variable measuring annual household income. While not the sole determinant of class, income provides the economic foundation for lifestyle choices and wealth accumulation.

- **Wealth**: Continuous variable representing total accumulated assets minus debts (net worth). Wealth provides economic security and opportunities that income alone cannot capture, including the ability to weather economic shocks and invest in future opportunities.

- **Cultural Capital**: Composite score measuring cultural knowledge, participation in high-culture activities, language skills, and social connections. This variable captures Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital, which can be converted into economic and social advantages.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds039_sociology_social_class_workingmiddleupper.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations and no anomalous values.
- **Dirty Version** (`ds039_sociology_social_class_workingmiddleupper_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as survey non-response and data entry errors.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Classification**: Excellent for handling mixed data types and capturing non-linear relationships between socioeconomic variables. The interpretability of feature importance can provide insights into which factors most strongly predict class membership.

- **Logistic Regression (Multinomial)**: Provides interpretable coefficients showing the relationship between each predictor and class membership probabilities. Particularly useful for understanding how changes in income, education, or cultural capital affect class classification odds.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for finding optimal decision boundaries in the multidimensional space of socioeconomic characteristics, especially when class boundaries are not clearly linear.
