# Background and Use Case

Dr. Sarah Chen's laboratory at the Institute for Molecular Biology is developing a new gene therapy approach for treating muscular dystrophy. The therapy involves introducing therapeutic genes into patient muscle cells, but the success of the treatment depends critically on achieving optimal protein expression levels. Too little protein expression results in ineffective treatment, while excessive expression can be toxic to cells.

The research team has been conducting extensive experiments to understand how different factors influence the expression of their therapeutic protein. They've systematically varied gene promoter strengths (weak, moderate, strong), tested different cell types (muscle cells, fibroblasts, stem cells), applied various cellular stressors (oxidative stress, heat shock, nutrient depletion), and measured protein levels at different time points after gene induction.

The laboratory needs a predictive model to optimize experimental conditions before conducting expensive and time-consuming cell culture experiments. By accurately predicting protein expression levels based on experimental parameters, they can design more efficient experiments, reduce costs, and accelerate the development of their gene therapy approach.

# Problem Statement

Given experimental conditions including gene promoter strength, cell type, applied stressors, and time since induction, predict the resulting protein expression level in cells. This prediction enables researchers to optimize experimental design and understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that control protein production.

# Target Variable

**Protein Expression Level**: Measured in relative fluorescence units (RFU) using flow cytometry, this continuous variable represents the abundance of the target protein within cells. Values typically range from 100 to 10,000 RFU, where higher values indicate greater protein production. This measurement is crucial because protein expression level directly correlates with therapeutic efficacy in gene therapy applications. Understanding and predicting these levels helps researchers optimize treatment protocols and avoid both under-dosing (ineffective treatment) and over-dosing (potential toxicity).

# Predictor Variables

- **Gene Promoter Strength**: Categorical variable (weak, moderate, strong) representing the transcriptional activity of the DNA sequence that initiates gene expression. Stronger promoters typically drive higher protein production but may also be more susceptible to cellular regulation.

- **Cell Type**: Categorical variable indicating the specific cell line used (muscle cells, fibroblasts, stem cells). Different cell types have distinct transcriptional machinery, metabolic states, and protein synthesis capabilities, significantly affecting expression outcomes.

- **Stressors**: Categorical variable describing environmental stress conditions applied to cells (none, oxidative stress, heat shock, nutrient depletion). Cellular stress can either enhance or suppress protein expression through various regulatory pathways.

- **Time Since Induction**: Continuous variable measured in hours (0-72 hours) representing the elapsed time after gene expression was initiated. Protein levels typically increase over time but may plateau or decline due to protein degradation or cellular adaptation.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds022_biology_protein_expression_level.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds022_biology_protein_expression_level_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world experimental data where measurements may fail or equipment malfunctions can produce erroneous readings

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between categorical and continuous variables, while providing feature importance insights valuable for biological interpretation

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Highly effective for mixed data types and can model complex temporal dynamics and interaction effects between promoter strength and cellular conditions

- **Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction Terms**: Provides interpretable coefficients and hypothesis testing capabilities, essential for understanding biological mechanisms and publishing scientific results
