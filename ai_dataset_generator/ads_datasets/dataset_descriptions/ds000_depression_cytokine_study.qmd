# Overview

This dataset contains clinical data from a large-scale study investigating the relationship between inflammatory cytokine biomarkers and depression diagnosis. The goal is to predict depression status based on a panel of inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and relevant demographic and lifestyle factors. This classification problem is particularly relevant for developing objective biological tests for depression, which currently relies primarily on subjective symptom assessments.

# Background and Use Case

The Neuropsychiatric Biomarker Research Consortium has been investigating the inflammatory hypothesis of depression, which suggests that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the development and maintenance of major depressive disorder (MDD). Growing evidence indicates that individuals with depression often exhibit elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered stress hormone profiles compared to healthy controls.

Current diagnosis of depression relies heavily on clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, which can be subjective and may miss cases or result in delayed diagnosis. The research team has collected comprehensive biomarker data from 500,000 participants, measuring a panel of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, CRP, IFN-gamma), anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10), stress hormones (cortisol), along with demographic and lifestyle factors known to influence both inflammation and mental health.

The challenge is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals with depression based on these objective biological markers. Such a model could potentially serve as a complementary diagnostic tool, help identify depression subtypes with distinct biological profiles, guide treatment selection (particularly for anti-inflammatory interventions), and monitor treatment response through changes in biomarker profiles.

# Problem Statement

Develop a classification model to predict depression diagnosis (Yes/No) based on inflammatory cytokine profiles, cortisol levels, and relevant demographic and lifestyle variables. The model should help identify biological signatures of depression and potentially serve as an objective diagnostic aid.

# Target Variable

**Depression**: Binary diagnosis indicating presence (Yes) or absence (No) of major depressive disorder based on structured clinical interview (DSM-5 criteria). The diagnosis was made by trained clinicians using standardized diagnostic protocols. This target variable is particularly valuable because:

- It represents a clinically validated diagnosis rather than self-reported symptoms
- It could enable earlier detection through objective biomarker screening
- It may help identify depression subtypes with distinct inflammatory profiles
- It could guide personalized treatment decisions, particularly for anti-inflammatory interventions
- It provides a foundation for developing blood-based diagnostic tests for depression

The dataset has approximately 30% prevalence of depression, reflecting the enriched clinical sample design where individuals with suspected depression were oversampled to ensure sufficient positive cases for model training.

# Predictor Variables

## Inflammatory Cytokines

- **IL6** (Interleukin-6, pg/mL): A key pro-inflammatory cytokine that regulates immune responses and has been consistently associated with depression. Elevated IL-6 can affect neurotransmitter metabolism and neural circuits involved in mood regulation.

- **TNF_alpha** (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, pg/mL): A major pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in systemic inflammation. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been linked to depression and can affect serotonin metabolism and hippocampal neuroplasticity.

- **IL1_beta** (Interleukin-1 beta, pg/mL): A pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response. It can influence hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and has been implicated in depression pathophysiology.

- **CRP** (C-Reactive Protein, mg/L): An acute phase protein and general marker of inflammation. Elevated CRP is associated with increased risk of depression and may indicate chronic low-grade systemic inflammation.

- **IFN_gamma** (Interferon gamma, pg/mL): A cytokine critical for immune regulation that has been associated with depression, particularly in the context of immune activation and stress responses.

- **IL10** (Interleukin-10, pg/mL): An anti-inflammatory cytokine that helps regulate immune responses. Lower IL-10 levels (reduced anti-inflammatory capacity) have been observed in some individuals with depression.

## Stress Hormone

- **Cortisol** (μg/dL): The primary stress hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Dysregulated cortisol levels (both elevated and blunted patterns) are common in depression and reflect HPA axis dysfunction.

## Demographic Variables

- **Age** (years, 18-75): Age is an important factor as both inflammatory markers and depression risk vary across the lifespan. Mid-life and older adults may show different inflammatory-depression relationships than younger adults.

- **Gender**: Biological sex influences both immune function and depression risk. Women have higher rates of depression and may show different inflammatory profiles compared to men.

## Lifestyle Factors

- **BMI** (Body Mass Index): Adipose tissue produces inflammatory cytokines, and obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. BMI is also related to depression risk through multiple pathways.

- **Sleep Hours** (average hours per night): Sleep disturbances are both a symptom and risk factor for depression. Poor sleep is also associated with increased inflammation and altered immune function.

- **Smoking Status**: Smoking affects inflammatory processes and is more prevalent among individuals with depression. It can confound relationships between cytokines and mental health.

# Correlations in the Data

The dataset includes several biologically meaningful correlations between inflammatory markers:

- **IL-6 and CRP** (r = 0.72): Strong correlation reflecting that IL-6 stimulates hepatic production of CRP
- **TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta** (r = 0.65): Both are primary pro-inflammatory cytokines often co-regulated
- **IL-6 and TNF-alpha** (r = 0.58): These cytokines are part of the same inflammatory cascade
- **Cortisol and IL-6** (r = 0.48): Reflects the bidirectional relationship between stress hormones and inflammation

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds000_depression_cytokine_study.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning basic classification techniques. Contains complete data with no missing values or extreme outliers.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds000_depression_cytokine_study_dirty.csv`): Simulates real-world clinical data quality issues. Perfect for practicing data cleaning, handling missing biomarker values, and robust modeling approaches.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Logistic Regression**: Start with logistic regression to understand which biomarkers are most strongly associated with depression. This interpretable approach can help identify key inflammatory signatures and provide odds ratios for clinical interpretation.

- **Random Forest Classification**: Use ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships between multiple cytokines and their interactions. This approach can reveal which biomarkers are most important for prediction and handle the complex multivariate inflammatory profile.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Implement advanced boosting algorithms for potentially higher predictive accuracy. These methods excel at capturing subtle patterns in biomarker combinations that may distinguish depression cases.

- **Feature Engineering**: Consider creating composite inflammatory indices (e.g., pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory ratios), interaction terms between cytokines and demographic factors, and non-linear transformations of biomarker levels.

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes. The relationships between inflammatory markers and depression have been designed to reflect established findings in psychoneuroimmunology research while maintaining interpretability for learning purposes. The data patterns are based on real biomarker literature, including the following key findings:

- Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, CRP) show positive associations with depression
- Anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10) show negative associations (protective effect)
- Cortisol shows a positive association reflecting HPA axis dysfunction
- Lifestyle factors (BMI, sleep, smoking) contribute additional risk through inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathways

The dataset should not be used for actual clinical decision-making. Students can use this dataset to practice binary classification, feature selection, handling imbalanced classes, model evaluation (ROC curves, precision-recall), and interpreting results in a medical context.
