# Overview

This dataset contains customer behavioral data from an e-commerce platform, designed to predict whether website visitors will complete a product purchase. It combines digital engagement metrics with demographic information to create a comprehensive view of customer purchasing patterns, making it ideal for learning classification techniques in business analytics.

# Background and Use Case

TechStyle, a growing online fashion retailer, faces a common challenge in e-commerce: understanding which website visitors are most likely to convert into paying customers. With thousands of daily visitors but a conversion rate of only 3-5%, the company wants to develop a predictive model to identify high-intent customers in real-time.

The marketing team plans to use these predictions to trigger personalized interventions—such as targeted discount offers, live chat invitations, or product recommendations—to nudge potential customers toward completing their purchases. Additionally, the customer acquisition team wants to understand which demographic segments and behavioral patterns correlate most strongly with successful conversions to optimize their advertising spend across different channels.

This dataset represents a typical scenario where businesses combine clickstream data with customer demographics to drive revenue growth through data-driven decision making. The ability to predict purchase intent has direct implications for marketing ROI, inventory management, and customer experience optimization.

# Problem Statement

Given a customer's browsing behavior, email engagement history, and demographic characteristics, predict whether they will complete a product purchase during their current website session. This binary classification problem is fundamental to e-commerce optimization and represents a key application of machine learning in digital marketing.

# Target Variable

**Product Purchase (Yes/No)**: A binary indicator of whether the customer completed at least one product purchase during their website session. This variable captures the ultimate goal of e-commerce platforms—converting visitors into buyers. Accurate prediction of this outcome enables businesses to:

- Implement dynamic pricing strategies for high-intent customers
- Allocate customer service resources more effectively
- Reduce cart abandonment through timely interventions
- Optimize marketing spend by focusing on convertible segments
- Improve overall user experience through personalized recommendations

# Predictor Variables

The dataset includes four key categories of predictor variables:

- **Browsing Time (minutes)**: Total time spent on the website during the current session. Longer browsing times often indicate higher engagement and purchase intent, though very long sessions might also suggest confusion or difficulty finding desired products.

- **Cart Additions**: Number of items added to the shopping cart during the session. This behavioral signal is typically one of the strongest predictors of purchase intent, as it represents concrete buying interest beyond passive browsing.

- **Email Opens**: Count of marketing emails opened by the customer in the past 30 days. This metric reflects engagement with the brand beyond the website and indicates receptiveness to marketing communications.

- **Demographic Information**: Customer characteristics including age group, geographic region, and device type (mobile vs. desktop). These variables help capture systematic differences in purchasing behavior across customer segments and can reveal important interaction effects with behavioral metrics.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions to support different learning objectives:

- **Clean Version** (`ds028_business_product_purchase_yesno.csv`): Contains complete, consistent data with no missing values or outliers. Ideal for initial model development, algorithm comparison, and understanding fundamental relationships between variables.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds028_business_product_purchase_yesno_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues commonly encountered in business analytics. Perfect for learning data preprocessing techniques, handling missing data, and building robust models.

# Suggested Approaches

Several machine learning approaches are well-suited for this classification problem:

1. **Logistic Regression**: An excellent starting point that provides interpretable coefficients for understanding the relationship between each predictor and purchase probability. Particularly valuable for business stakeholders who need to understand model decisions.

2. **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between variables effectively, while providing feature importance rankings. Robust to outliers and missing values, making it ideal for the dirty dataset version.

3. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Often achieves high predictive accuracy on tabular business data by sequentially learning from prediction errors. Excellent for scenarios where prediction accuracy is the primary objective.
