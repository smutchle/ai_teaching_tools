# Overview

This dataset contains environmental measurements for classifying drought severity levels across agricultural regions. With climate change intensifying water scarcity challenges globally, accurate drought prediction has become crucial for agricultural planning, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. The dataset includes key environmental indicators measured across 500,000 monitoring stations to predict drought intensity on a 5-level scale.

# Background and Use Case

The Global Agricultural Monitoring Initiative (GAMI) has deployed environmental sensors across farming regions in the American Midwest to develop an early warning system for drought conditions. With increasing frequency of extreme weather events, farmers and agricultural cooperatives need reliable predictions of drought severity to make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation scheduling, and insurance planning.

Regional water management authorities use this classification system to implement tiered water restrictions and allocate emergency resources. For example, Level 1 (minimal drought) might trigger voluntary water conservation measures, while Level 5 (extreme drought) could mandate strict water rationing and activate emergency agricultural support programs. Insurance companies also rely on these predictions to assess crop failure risks and adjust premium calculations.

The monitoring stations collect real-time data on precipitation patterns, soil conditions, temperature fluctuations, and vegetation health. This multi-faceted approach provides a comprehensive view of drought conditions that goes beyond simple rainfall measurements, enabling more nuanced and accurate severity classifications.

# Problem Statement

Given environmental measurements from monitoring stations, predict the drought severity level (1-5 scale) to enable proactive agricultural and water management decisions. This multi-class classification problem requires identifying subtle patterns across multiple environmental indicators to distinguish between different levels of water stress.

# Target Variable

**Drought Severity (5 levels)**: A categorical variable representing the intensity of drought conditions, classified as:
- **Level 1 (Minimal)**: Normal to slightly below-normal water availability
- **Level 2 (Moderate)**: Noticeable water stress beginning to affect vegetation
- **Level 3 (Severe)**: Significant agricultural impacts and water restrictions needed
- **Level 4 (Extreme)**: Widespread crop failure risk and mandatory water conservation
- **Level 5 (Exceptional)**: Emergency conditions requiring immediate intervention

This classification system follows established meteorological standards and provides actionable categories for decision-making. Accurate prediction enables stakeholders to implement appropriate response measures before conditions deteriorate further.

# Predictor Variables

- **Precipitation Deficit**: Measured as percentage below normal rainfall for the region and season. This primary indicator reflects the fundamental water input shortage that drives drought conditions.

- **Soil Moisture**: Volumetric water content in the root zone (0-100%), indicating water availability for plant uptake. Low soil moisture often persists longer than precipitation deficits and directly impacts crop health.

- **Temperature**: Average temperature deviation from seasonal norms (°C). Higher temperatures accelerate evapotranspiration, intensifying drought effects even with moderate precipitation deficits.

- **Vegetation Stress**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomaly indicating plant health and photosynthetic activity. This remote sensing metric provides early detection of drought impacts on vegetation before visible wilting occurs.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds044_geoscience_drought_severity_5_levels.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations and no measurement errors.
- **Dirty Version** (`ds044_geoscience_drought_severity_5_levels_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as sensor malfunctions, communication errors, and extreme measurement conditions.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest**: Excellent for handling non-linear relationships between environmental variables and naturally handles feature interactions. The ensemble approach provides robust predictions even with some data quality issues.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Particularly effective for this type of environmental classification problem, with strong performance on tabular data and built-in handling of missing values in the dirty dataset version.

- **Ordinal Classification**: Since drought levels have a natural ordering (1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5), specialized ordinal regression techniques can leverage this structure for improved predictions and more interpretable results.
