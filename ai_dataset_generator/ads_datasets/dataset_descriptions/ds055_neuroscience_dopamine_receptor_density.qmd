# Background and Use Case

Dr. Sarah Chen, a computational neuroscientist at a major research university, is investigating the factors that influence dopamine receptor availability in the human brain. Her research team uses positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radioligands to measure dopamine receptor density across different brain regions in healthy volunteers and patients with neurological conditions.

Understanding dopamine receptor density is crucial for multiple reasons: it helps explain individual differences in motivation, reward processing, and motor control; it serves as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease; and it can predict treatment response to dopaminergic medications. Dr. Chen's lab has collected data from 500,000 participants over several years, measuring receptor density alongside genetic profiles, lifestyle factors, and medication histories.

The research team wants to develop predictive models that can estimate dopamine receptor density based on easily obtainable clinical and demographic information. This would be invaluable for clinical settings where expensive PET imaging might not be readily available, and could help personalize treatment approaches for patients with dopamine-related disorders.

# Problem Statement

Given demographic, genetic, and clinical information about an individual, predict their dopamine receptor density in neural tissue. This regression problem aims to identify the key factors that influence dopaminergic neurotransmission and develop models that could assist in clinical decision-making and research participant screening.

# Target Variable

**Dopamine Receptor Density**: Measured in binding potential (BP) units, this represents the availability of dopamine receptors in neural tissue as quantified through PET imaging. Values typically range from 0.5 to 4.0 BP units, with higher values indicating greater receptor availability. This measure is critical because:

- It reflects the brain's capacity for dopaminergic signaling
- Reduced density is associated with aging, addiction, and neurodegenerative diseases
- It can predict treatment response to dopamine-modulating medications
- It serves as a biomarker for monitoring disease progression

# Predictor Variables

- **Age**: Participant age in years. Dopamine receptor density typically declines with aging at a rate of approximately 6-10% per decade, making age a crucial predictor.

- **Genetic Variants**: Composite score (0-10) representing the presence of genetic polymorphisms known to affect dopamine metabolism and receptor expression, including variants in DRD2, COMT, and DAT1 genes.

- **Substance Use History**: Categorical variable indicating history of substance use that affects dopamine systems (None, Alcohol, Tobacco, Stimulants, Multiple). Chronic substance use can lead to receptor downregulation.

- **Medication**: Current medication status affecting dopamine systems (None, Antipsychotics, Antidepressants, Parkinson's_Meds, Other). Various medications can influence receptor availability through different mechanisms.

- **Brain Region**: The specific brain region where receptor density was measured (Striatum, Prefrontal_Cortex, Midbrain, Temporal_Cortex). Different regions show varying baseline receptor densities and age-related changes.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds055_neuroscience_dopamine_receptor_density.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core regression concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds055_neuroscience_dopamine_receptor_density_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete genetic testing, missing clinical history, or measurement artifacts

# Suggested Approaches

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Start with linear models to understand the relationship between predictors and receptor density, particularly useful for interpreting the effect of age and genetic factors.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, especially important given the complex interplay between genetics, medication, and brain region effects.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Powerful ensemble methods that can model complex patterns while providing feature importance rankings to identify the most influential factors affecting receptor density.
