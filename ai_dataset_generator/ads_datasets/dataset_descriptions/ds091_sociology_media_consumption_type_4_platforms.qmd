# Background and Use Case

In today's rapidly evolving media landscape, understanding how different demographic groups consume information has become crucial for policymakers, researchers, and media organizations. The rise of social media, streaming platforms, and digital news sources has fundamentally changed how people access information, creating new patterns of media consumption that often correlate with age, education, income, and technology access.

A regional media research institute is conducting a comprehensive study to understand information consumption patterns across their community. They want to develop predictive models that can help identify which primary information source different demographic groups are likely to prefer. This research will inform public policy decisions about information accessibility, help libraries and community centers tailor their services, and assist local government in ensuring equitable access to important civic information.

The findings from this analysis could be used to identify underserved populations, predict future media consumption trends, and develop targeted outreach strategies to ensure all community members have access to reliable information sources regardless of their demographic background.

# Problem Statement

Given demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals, predict their primary media consumption platform. This classification problem helps us understand the digital divide and information accessibility patterns in modern society.

# Target Variable

**Media Consumption Type (4 platforms)**: This categorical variable represents an individual's primary source for news and information consumption. The four platforms likely include traditional media (newspapers/TV), social media platforms, streaming services, and digital news websites. Understanding these preferences is crucial for:
- Identifying information accessibility gaps across different demographic groups
- Predicting future media consumption trends
- Developing inclusive communication strategies for public health, civic engagement, and emergency communications
- Addressing digital divide issues in policy planning

# Predictor Variables

- **Age**: A critical demographic factor that strongly influences technology adoption and media preferences, with different generations showing distinct consumption patterns
- **Education**: Educational attainment often correlates with information-seeking behavior, critical media literacy, and preference for different types of content sources
- **Income**: Economic status affects access to premium platforms, high-speed internet, and devices, directly impacting media consumption choices
- **Technology Access**: Measures the level of technological infrastructure available to individuals (internet quality, device ownership, digital literacy)
- **Content Preferences**: Indicates the type of content individuals prefer (news, entertainment, educational, social), which influences platform choice

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds091_sociology_media_consumption_type_4_platforms.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations
- **Dirty Version** (`ds091_sociology_media_consumption_type_4_platforms_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as survey non-response and data entry errors

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Excellent for handling mixed data types and providing feature importance insights to understand which demographic factors most strongly predict media preferences
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Interpretable approach that can reveal the relationship between demographic characteristics and the probability of preferring each platform
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: High-performance ensemble method that can capture complex interactions between socioeconomic factors and media consumption patterns

# Educational Value

This dataset offers students the opportunity to:
- Explore classification problems with sociological implications
- Practice handling categorical target variables with multiple classes
- Understand the digital divide through data analysis
- Work with realistic demographic and socioeconomic variables
- Compare model performance between clean and messy real-world data

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes. The relationships between variables have been designed to reflect realistic patterns observed in media consumption research while maintaining interpretability for learning objectives. The demographic and socioeconomic patterns embedded in the data are based on established sociology research findings about digital divide and media consumption behaviors.
