# Overview

This comprehensive employee attrition dataset enables students to explore one of the most critical challenges facing modern organizations: predicting and preventing employee turnover. By analyzing key workplace factors including compensation, work-life balance, job satisfaction, tenure, and career advancement, learners can build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving and understand the underlying drivers of workplace retention.

# Background and Use Case

TechFlow Solutions, a mid-sized software consulting firm with 500,000 employees, has been experiencing concerning turnover rates over the past two years. The company's HR director, Sarah Chen, noticed that employee departures were not only costly (estimated at 150% of an employee's annual salary when factoring in recruitment, training, and productivity loss) but also seemed to follow certain patterns that weren't immediately obvious.

The executive team commissioned a comprehensive study to understand what factors most strongly predict employee attrition. They collected data on employee compensation, daily commute times, job satisfaction scores from quarterly surveys, years of service, and promotion history. The goal was to develop a predictive model that could identify at-risk employees early, allowing HR to implement targeted retention strategies such as salary adjustments, flexible work arrangements, or accelerated career development programs.

This analysis became even more critical as the company planned to expand into new markets, making it essential to retain institutional knowledge and maintain team stability. The insights from this model would inform not only individual retention efforts but also broader HR policies around compensation structures, remote work options, and career development pathways.

# Problem Statement

The core challenge is to predict whether an employee will stay with the company or leave within the next 12 months, based on their current workplace characteristics and employment history. This binary classification problem requires identifying the most influential factors in employee retention decisions and building a model that can accurately flag employees who may be considering departure, enabling proactive intervention strategies.

# Target Variable

**Employee Attrition (Stay/Leave)**: This binary variable indicates whether an employee remained with the company (Stay) or voluntarily departed (Leave) during the observation period. Understanding attrition patterns is crucial for organizational planning, as high turnover rates can lead to:

- Increased recruitment and training costs
- Loss of institutional knowledge and expertise
- Reduced team productivity and morale
- Disruption of client relationships and project continuity
- Negative impact on company culture and employer branding

Predicting attrition allows organizations to implement targeted retention strategies, optimize resource allocation for HR initiatives, and maintain competitive advantage through workforce stability.

# Predictor Variables

- **Salary**: Annual compensation in USD, representing the employee's current base salary. Compensation is often a primary factor in retention decisions, with underpaid employees more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere.

- **Commute Time**: Daily commute duration in minutes (one-way). Longer commutes can significantly impact work-life balance, job satisfaction, and ultimately retention, especially in an era where remote work options are increasingly valued.

- **Job Satisfaction**: Score from 1-10 based on quarterly employee surveys, measuring overall contentment with role responsibilities, work environment, management, and company culture. This subjective measure often serves as a strong predictor of future employment decisions.

- **Years at Company**: Total tenure with the organization, indicating employee loyalty, career investment, and accumulated benefits. Both very short tenure (early-career departures) and very long tenure (late-career transitions) can influence attrition patterns differently.

- **Promotions**: Total number of promotions received during employment, reflecting career advancement opportunities and recognition. Limited promotion opportunities often correlate with increased attrition risk, particularly among high-performing employees.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds029_business_employee_attrition_stayleave.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core classification techniques without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds029_business_employee_attrition_stayleave_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete survey responses, data entry errors, and exceptional cases

# Suggested Approaches

- **Logistic Regression**: Excellent starting point for interpretable results, allowing clear understanding of how each factor influences attrition probability and providing actionable insights for HR policy decisions.

- **Random Forest**: Robust ensemble method that can capture non-linear relationships and variable interactions while providing feature importance rankings to identify the most critical retention factors.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: High-performance approach for maximum predictive accuracy, particularly valuable when the cost of missing at-risk employees is high and precision in predictions is paramount.
