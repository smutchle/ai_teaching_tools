# Overview

This dataset contains measurements of coastal erosion rates along various shoreline segments, designed to help predict annual shoreline retreat based on key environmental and physical factors. The dataset serves as an excellent introduction to environmental regression modeling, combining oceanographic, geological, and ecological variables to understand one of the most pressing challenges in coastal zone management.

# Background and Use Case

Imagine you're working as a data scientist for the National Coastal Management Agency, tasked with developing a predictive model to assess erosion risk along thousands of kilometers of coastline. With rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity due to climate change, coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems face unprecedented threats from shoreline retreat.

Your agency needs to prioritize limited resources for coastal protection measures such as beach nourishment, seawall construction, or managed retreat programs. Traditional field surveys are expensive and time-consuming, often taking years to establish erosion trends. However, environmental factors like wave energy, tidal patterns, and sediment characteristics can be measured or estimated much more quickly using remote sensing and oceanographic models.

The challenge is to develop a reliable predictive model that can estimate annual erosion rates based on these readily available environmental indicators. This would enable rapid assessment of erosion risk for newly surveyed areas, support emergency response planning, and help coastal managers make informed decisions about long-term adaptation strategies.

# Problem Statement

Develop a regression model to predict the annual coastal erosion rate (meters per year of shoreline retreat) based on oceanographic, geological, and ecological characteristics of coastal segments. The model should be accurate enough to support coastal management decisions and robust enough to handle the variability inherent in natural coastal systems.

# Target Variable

**Coastal Erosion Rate**: Measured in meters per year, this variable represents the average annual rate of shoreline retreat over a multi-year observation period. Positive values indicate landward movement of the shoreline (erosion), while negative values would indicate seaward movement (accretion). This metric is crucial for coastal planning as it directly translates to land loss, infrastructure risk, and ecosystem habitat changes. Understanding and predicting erosion rates enables proactive coastal management, from determining setback requirements for new construction to scheduling beach nourishment projects and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different protection strategies.

# Predictor Variables

- **Wave Energy**: Measured in kilojoules per meter of coastline, this represents the average annual wave power reaching the shore. Higher wave energy typically correlates with increased erosion as waves provide the primary mechanism for sediment transport and cliff undercutting.

- **Tidal Range**: The average difference between high and low tide levels in meters. Larger tidal ranges can increase erosion by exposing more of the shore face to wave action and creating stronger tidal currents that transport sediment away from the shore.

- **Sediment Type**: Categorical variable representing the dominant substrate material (e.g., sand, clay, rock, mixed). Different sediment types have varying resistance to erosion, with cohesive materials like clay generally more resistant than loose sand, while rocky shores may be highly resistant to short-term erosion.

- **Vegetation Coverage**: Percentage of the backshore area covered by vegetation (0-100%). Vegetation, particularly deep-rooted species, can significantly reduce erosion by stabilizing sediments, reducing surface runoff, and dissipating wave energy.

- **Sea Level Trend**: The local rate of relative sea level rise in millimeters per year, accounting for both global sea level change and local land subsidence or uplift. Rising sea levels generally accelerate erosion by allowing waves to reach higher on the shore and increasing the frequency of storm surge impacts.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds069_geoscience_coastal_erosion_rate.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental regression techniques. Contains complete data for all observations with realistic but clean measurements.
- **Dirty Version** (`ds069_geoscience_coastal_erosion_rate_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as equipment failures, measurement errors, or extreme weather events that can disrupt data collection.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Start with this interpretable baseline to understand linear relationships between predictors and erosion rates. Particularly valuable for identifying which factors have the strongest influence on coastal erosion.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables (e.g., how vegetation effectiveness might depend on wave energy levels). Also provides feature importance rankings and handles mixed data types well.

- **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Often achieve high predictive accuracy for environmental datasets and can capture complex patterns while providing insights into variable interactions through SHAP analysis.
