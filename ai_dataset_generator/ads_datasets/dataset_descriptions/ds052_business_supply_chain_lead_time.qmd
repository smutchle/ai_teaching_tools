# Background and Use Case

GlobalTech Manufacturing operates across six continents, sourcing components from over 500 suppliers worldwide for their consumer electronics production lines. Following supply chain disruptions in recent years, the company's procurement team has been tasked with developing a predictive model to accurately estimate lead times for incoming orders. This capability is crucial for production planning, inventory management, and meeting customer delivery commitments.

The company's Chief Supply Chain Officer, Sarah Chen, initiated this data science project after experiencing significant delays that resulted in $2.3 million in lost revenue due to production stoppages. "We need to move from reactive to predictive supply chain management," she explained to the analytics team. "If we can accurately forecast lead times, we can optimize our buffer inventory, negotiate better terms with suppliers, and most importantly, keep our production lines running smoothly."

The dataset represents six months of order data from GlobalTech's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, capturing the key variables that the procurement team believes influence delivery times. This information will be used to build machine learning models that can provide real-time lead time estimates for new orders, enabling better decision-making across the organization.

# Problem Statement

Develop a regression model to predict the number of days between order placement and delivery completion (lead time) based on supplier characteristics, order specifications, and logistics factors. Accurate lead time predictions will enable proactive inventory management, improved production scheduling, and enhanced customer satisfaction through more reliable delivery commitments.

# Target Variable

**Supply Chain Lead Time**: Measured in days from the moment an order is placed with a supplier until the goods are received and processed at GlobalTech's receiving facilities. This metric is critical for business operations as it directly impacts production scheduling, inventory costs, and customer satisfaction. Lead times typically range from 5 days for local suppliers with simple products to over 60 days for complex international orders requiring extensive customs processing. Accurate prediction of this variable enables companies to optimize working capital, reduce stockouts, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

# Predictor Variables

- **Supplier Distance**: Geographic distance in kilometers between the supplier's facility and GlobalTech's receiving center. This variable captures the fundamental logistics constraint of physical transportation time and complexity. Longer distances typically correlate with extended lead times due to transportation duration, increased likelihood of delays, and more complex routing requirements.

- **Order Complexity**: A composite score (1-10 scale) reflecting the technical sophistication and manufacturing difficulty of the ordered items. Higher complexity scores indicate products requiring specialized manufacturing processes, quality inspections, or custom configurations. Complex orders often require additional production time, quality assurance steps, and specialized handling procedures.

- **Customs Requirements**: Categorical variable indicating the level of customs and regulatory processing required (None, Standard, Complex). International orders face varying degrees of customs scrutiny, documentation requirements, and potential delays. Complex customs requirements may involve specialized permits, detailed inspections, or compliance with specific trade regulations.

- **Shipping Method**: The transportation mode selected for order delivery (Ground, Air, Sea, Express). Each method offers different trade-offs between cost, speed, and reliability. Express shipping provides fastest delivery but at premium cost, while sea freight offers economical transport for large volumes with longer transit times.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds052_business_supply_chain_lead_time.csv`): Contains complete, validated data with no missing values or outliers. Ideal for initial model development, algorithm comparison, and learning fundamental regression techniques without data quality complications.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds052_business_supply_chain_lead_time_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues commonly encountered in enterprise systems. Perfect for practicing data cleaning, outlier detection, and robust modeling techniques that handle imperfect data.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to establish baseline performance and understand linear relationships between predictors and lead time. This interpretable approach will help identify the most influential factors and provide business stakeholders with clear insights into how each variable impacts delivery timelines.

- **Random Forest**: Implement ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. Random forests can effectively handle the mixed data types (continuous distance, categorical shipping methods) and provide feature importance rankings to guide business decision-making.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Deploy advanced boosting algorithms for maximum predictive accuracy, particularly useful for the dirty dataset version. These methods excel at handling missing values and can capture complex patterns that may exist between supplier characteristics and lead time outcomes.
