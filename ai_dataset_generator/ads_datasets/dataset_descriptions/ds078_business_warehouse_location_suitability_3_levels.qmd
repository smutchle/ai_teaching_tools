format: html
---

# Overview

This dataset contains comprehensive site evaluation data for distribution center location decisions, featuring 500,000 potential warehouse sites assessed across multiple critical business factors. Each location is classified into one of three suitability levels based on strategic business considerations including transportation infrastructure, labor market conditions, market proximity, land costs, and utility availability.

# Background and Use Case

GlobalSupply Corp, a major retail distribution company, is expanding its logistics network to meet growing e-commerce demand across the Southeast region. The company has identified 500,000 potential sites for new distribution centers and needs to systematically evaluate each location's suitability for warehouse operations. This evaluation is critical as distribution center placement directly impacts delivery times, operational costs, and customer satisfaction.

The site selection process involves analyzing multiple interconnected factors that affect both short-term operational efficiency and long-term strategic positioning. Transportation access determines how easily goods can move in and out of the facility, while labor costs affect ongoing operational expenses. Proximity to key markets influences delivery speed and transportation costs, land costs impact initial investment requirements, and utility infrastructure affects operational reliability and costs.

This type of multi-criteria decision making is common in supply chain management, where companies must balance competing priorities such as cost minimization and service level optimization. The classification approach helps standardize the decision-making process and enables consistent evaluation across large numbers of potential sites.

# Problem Statement

Given key location characteristics, predict whether a potential warehouse site should be classified as "High Suitability," "Moderate Suitability," or "Low Suitability" for distribution center development. This classification enables efficient screening of large numbers of potential sites and supports strategic logistics network planning.

# Target Variable

**Warehouse Location Suitability (3 levels)**: A categorical variable representing the overall appropriateness of a site for distribution center operations:

- **High Suitability**: Sites with optimal characteristics across most factors, suitable for immediate development and expected to deliver strong operational performance
- **Moderate Suitability**: Sites with acceptable characteristics that may require some trade-offs or additional investment to optimize
- **Low Suitability**: Sites with significant limitations that make them unsuitable for current development needs or require substantial infrastructure investment

This classification is valuable for strategic planning as it enables rapid screening of large site portfolios, resource allocation for detailed site analysis, and standardized communication of site recommendations across stakeholder groups.

# Predictor Variables

- **Transportation Access**: Composite score measuring proximity to major highways, rail lines, ports, and airports. Higher scores indicate better multimodal transportation connectivity, which reduces shipping times and provides operational flexibility.

- **Labor Costs**: Average hourly wages for warehouse and logistics workers in the local market, including benefits and employment taxes. Lower costs improve operational margins but must be balanced against workforce availability and skill levels.

- **Proximity to Markets**: Distance-weighted accessibility to key customer markets and retail locations. Closer proximity reduces last-mile delivery costs and enables faster customer service, particularly important for e-commerce operations.

- **Land Cost**: Price per acre for industrial-zoned land suitable for warehouse development. Lower costs reduce initial capital investment but may indicate less desirable locations or limited infrastructure.

- **Utilities**: Availability and reliability of essential utilities including electricity, water, telecommunications, and natural gas. Strong utility infrastructure ensures operational continuity and supports advanced warehouse technologies.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds078_business_warehouse_location_suitability_3_levels.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental classification techniques
- **Dirty Version** (`ds078_business_warehouse_location_suitability_3_levels_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as incomplete site surveys or measurement errors

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest**: Excellent for handling mixed data types and providing feature importance rankings to understand which location factors most strongly influence suitability decisions
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Provides interpretable coefficients showing how each factor affects the probability of different suitability classifications
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Effective for capturing complex interactions between location factors, such as how transportation access and market proximity jointly influence suitability
