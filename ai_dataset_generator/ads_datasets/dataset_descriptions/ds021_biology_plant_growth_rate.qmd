# Background and Use Case

A team of agricultural researchers at the International Crop Research Institute is investigating how different environmental factors influence plant growth rates to develop evidence-based recommendations for greenhouse management and precision agriculture. With global food security becoming increasingly important due to climate change and population growth, understanding the optimal conditions for plant growth has never been more critical.

The research team has been conducting controlled experiments in climate chambers, systematically varying environmental conditions including light intensity, nutrient concentrations, temperature, water availability, and atmospheric CO2 levels. Each experimental unit represents a controlled growing environment where young plants are monitored over a standardized period, with their daily biomass increase carefully measured.

This data will be used to develop predictive models that can help farmers and greenhouse operators optimize growing conditions, reduce resource waste, and maximize crop productivity. The insights gained could also inform climate-controlled agriculture systems and vertical farming operations where precise environmental control is both possible and economically justified.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the daily plant growth rate (measured as biomass increase in grams per day) based on five key environmental variables. This regression problem aims to quantify how changes in growing conditions affect plant productivity, enabling data-driven optimization of agricultural systems.

# Target Variable

**Plant Growth Rate**: Measured as the daily increase in plant biomass (grams per day), this variable represents the rate at which plants accumulate dry matter under specific environmental conditions. This metric is crucial because it directly correlates with crop yield and productivity. A higher growth rate indicates more efficient conversion of environmental resources into plant tissue, which translates to better harvests and more sustainable resource utilization. Understanding and predicting growth rates allows agricultural practitioners to identify optimal growing conditions and make informed decisions about resource allocation.

# Predictor Variables

- **Light Intensity**: Measured in micromoles of photons per square meter per second (μmol/m²/s). Light is the primary energy source for photosynthesis, and intensity directly affects the rate of carbon fixation and overall plant metabolism.

- **Nutrient Levels**: Quantified as parts per million (ppm) of essential nutrients in the growing medium. This represents the availability of key minerals like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are fundamental building blocks for plant growth and development.

- **Temperature**: Recorded in degrees Celsius (°C). Temperature affects enzymatic activity, metabolic rates, and cellular processes. Each plant species has an optimal temperature range for maximum growth efficiency.

- **Water Availability**: Measured as soil moisture percentage or water potential. Water is essential for photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and maintaining cellular structure. Both water stress and oversaturation can significantly impact growth rates.

- **CO2 Concentration**: Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels measured in parts per million (ppm). CO2 is the primary carbon source for photosynthesis, and elevated levels can enhance growth rates in many plant species, though this effect may plateau at higher concentrations.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds021_biology_plant_growth_rate.csv`): Contains complete data with no missing values or outliers, ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental regression concepts
- **Dirty Version** (`ds021_biology_plant_growth_rate_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as sensor malfunctions, measurement errors, or experimental complications

The dirty version provides valuable experience in data preprocessing, outlier detection, and missing value imputation techniques commonly encountered in biological research.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to establish baseline performance and understand linear relationships between environmental factors and growth rates
- **Random Forest**: Implement ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between environmental variables, while providing feature importance rankings
- **Gradient Boosting**: Use XGBoost or similar algorithms to model complex interactions and achieve high predictive accuracy, particularly useful for optimizing growing conditions

Advanced students might also explore polynomial features to capture optimal ranges for each environmental factor, or neural networks to model complex multi-way interactions between variables.
