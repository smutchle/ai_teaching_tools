# Background and Use Case

The Democratic Engagement Research Institute has been tasked by the National Election Commission to develop a predictive model for voter turnout across various electoral districts. With declining participation rates in recent elections, election officials need to better understand which factors most significantly impact citizen engagement and where targeted interventions might be most effective.

This research is particularly timely as election administrators face budget constraints and need to allocate resources strategically. By predicting voter turnout, they can optimize polling station locations, adjust staffing levels, and implement targeted civic engagement campaigns in areas where participation is expected to be low. Additionally, political scientists and policy makers can use these insights to design reforms that remove barriers to participation and strengthen democratic institutions.

The dataset represents a comprehensive analysis of electoral districts from the past five election cycles, incorporating data from election offices, meteorological services, educational departments, and demographic surveys. Each observation represents a single electoral district in a specific election, providing rich contextual information about the conditions that influenced voter participation.

# Problem Statement

The central challenge is to predict the percentage of eligible voters who will participate in an election based on observable characteristics of the electoral district and election conditions. This regression problem requires understanding how multiple socio-political and environmental factors interact to influence civic engagement, ultimately helping election officials and policymakers make data-driven decisions to strengthen democratic participation.

# Target Variable

**Voter Turnout Percentage**: This variable measures the proportion of eligible voters in an electoral district who actually cast ballots in an election, expressed as a percentage (0-100%). This metric is crucial for understanding democratic health and civic engagement levels. High turnout rates generally indicate robust democratic participation and legitimacy, while low turnout may suggest voter apathy, institutional barriers, or systemic issues that discourage participation. Predicting turnout helps election administrators plan resources, enables researchers to test theories about democratic engagement, and allows policymakers to evaluate the effectiveness of electoral reforms and civic education initiatives.

# Predictor Variables

- **Competitiveness**: Measures how close the election is expected to be in the district, typically calculated as the margin between the top two candidates or parties from previous elections. More competitive races generally drive higher turnout as voters perceive their individual votes as more consequential.

- **Weather**: Captures weather conditions on election day, including factors like temperature, precipitation, and severe weather warnings. Poor weather conditions have historically been associated with reduced voter turnout, as they increase the cost and inconvenience of voting.

- **Registration Barriers**: Quantifies the difficulty of voter registration in the district, including factors like registration deadlines, required documentation, office hours, and online availability. Higher barriers typically correlate with lower turnout, particularly among younger and more mobile populations.

- **Civic Education**: Measures the level of civic education programming in the district, including school curricula quality, adult education programs, and community engagement initiatives. Strong civic education typically correlates with higher political knowledge and increased likelihood of voting.

- **Age Demographics**: Captures the age distribution of eligible voters in the district, often represented as median age or percentage in key age brackets. Age is one of the strongest predictors of voting behavior, with older populations typically showing higher turnout rates than younger cohorts.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds066_sociology_voter_turnout_percentage.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, containing complete observations with no missing values or outliers. Perfect for students beginning their exploration of regression techniques and feature relationships.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds066_sociology_voter_turnout_percentage_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues that researchers commonly encounter when working with administrative and survey data. This version challenges students to implement data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to establish baseline performance and understand the linear relationships between predictors and voter turnout. This approach provides interpretable coefficients that can inform policy discussions.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Implement ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships and interaction effects between variables. Random forests can reveal which combinations of factors are most predictive of high or low turnout.

- **Gradient Boosting Models**: Use XGBoost or similar algorithms to achieve high predictive accuracy while maintaining some interpretability through feature importance scores. These models excel at capturing complex patterns in the data.
