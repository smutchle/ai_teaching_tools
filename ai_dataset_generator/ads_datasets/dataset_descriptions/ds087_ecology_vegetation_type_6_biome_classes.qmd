# Overview

This dataset contains environmental measurements from 500,000 ecological survey sites worldwide, designed to predict the dominant vegetation type based on key environmental factors. Students will work with realistic ecological data to classify sites into six major biome categories, providing hands-on experience with multi-class classification problems in environmental science.

# Background and Use Case

Climate change and habitat loss are dramatically altering ecosystems worldwide, making it crucial for ecologists and conservation biologists to understand the relationships between environmental conditions and vegetation communities. This dataset simulates data that might be collected by an international conservation organization conducting a global biodiversity assessment.

Imagine you're working with the Global Ecosystem Monitoring Initiative (GEMI), a fictional international research consortium tasked with mapping and predicting vegetation patterns across different continents. Field teams have collected environmental data from 500,000 representative sites, measuring key factors that influence plant community composition. Your task is to develop a predictive model that can classify the dominant vegetation type at new locations based solely on environmental measurements.

This type of analysis is essential for conservation planning, climate change impact assessment, and restoration ecology. By understanding which environmental factors most strongly predict vegetation types, researchers can identify areas at risk of ecosystem shifts, prioritize conservation efforts, and predict how plant communities might respond to changing climate conditions.

# Problem Statement

Given environmental measurements from ecological survey sites, predict which of six major biome types will dominate the plant community. This is a multi-class classification problem where accurate prediction can inform conservation strategies and ecosystem management decisions.

# Target Variable

**Vegetation Type (6 biome classes)**: This categorical variable represents the dominant plant community type at each survey site. The six classes likely include major global biomes such as:

- **Tropical Rainforest**: Dense, multi-layered forests in warm, wet climates
- **Temperate Deciduous Forest**: Seasonal forests with leaf-dropping trees
- **Grassland/Prairie**: Herbaceous plant communities in moderate rainfall areas  
- **Desert**: Sparse vegetation adapted to arid conditions
- **Boreal Forest/Taiga**: Coniferous forests in cold climates
- **Tundra**: Low-growing vegetation in extremely cold, short growing seasons

Predicting vegetation type is valuable because it serves as a proxy for biodiversity, ecosystem services, carbon storage capacity, and habitat suitability for various species. These predictions can guide land use planning, conservation prioritization, and climate change adaptation strategies.

# Predictor Variables

- **Temperature**: Mean annual temperature (°C) - A primary driver of plant growth rates, species composition, and physiological processes. Different vegetation types are adapted to specific temperature ranges.

- **Precipitation**: Annual precipitation (mm) - Determines water availability, which is often the limiting factor for plant growth and strongly influences vegetation structure and diversity.

- **Elevation**: Height above sea level (meters) - Affects temperature, precipitation patterns, atmospheric pressure, and growing season length. Creates distinct vegetation zones on mountain slopes.

- **Soil Type**: Categorical variable representing major soil classifications - Influences nutrient availability, water retention, pH, and root penetration. Different plant communities are adapted to specific soil conditions.

- **Disturbance Regime**: Categorical variable describing the frequency and type of natural disturbances (fire, flooding, windstorms, etc.) - Shapes plant community composition by favoring species adapted to specific disturbance patterns.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds087_ecology_vegetation_type_6_biome_classes.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core classification concepts without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds087_ecology_vegetation_type_6_biome_classes_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as equipment failures, measurement errors, or extreme weather events during data collection

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest**: Excellent for handling mixed data types (continuous and categorical) and capturing complex interactions between environmental variables. Provides feature importance rankings to identify key ecological drivers.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Powerful ensemble method that can model non-linear relationships and interactions. Often performs well on ecological datasets with complex environmental gradients.

- **Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel**: Effective for multi-class problems with non-linear decision boundaries, which is common in ecological systems where vegetation types often transition gradually across environmental gradients.

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes. The relationships between environmental variables and vegetation types have been designed to reflect realistic ecological patterns while maintaining interpretability for learning. The data incorporates known ecological principles such as temperature-precipitation interactions, elevational gradients, and disturbance-succession dynamics.
