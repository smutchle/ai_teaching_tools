# Background and Use Case

Metro Property Solutions, a growing real estate technology company, has been manually appraising properties for over a decade. With the rapid expansion of urban markets and increasing client demands for instant property valuations, their traditional appraisal methods are becoming a bottleneck. The company's senior analyst team spends countless hours evaluating properties based on various factors, often leading to inconsistent pricing and delayed client responses.

The company has decided to develop an automated property valuation model (AVM) to streamline their pricing process. This system would serve multiple stakeholders: real estate agents could provide instant price estimates to potential buyers, property investors could quickly assess portfolio values, and mortgage lenders could accelerate their approval processes. The goal is to create a reliable, data-driven approach that can predict property prices with high accuracy while maintaining transparency in the decision-making process.

To build this system, Metro Property Solutions has compiled historical data from their database, including key property characteristics and final sale/rental prices. This dataset represents a typical challenge faced by PropTech companies worldwide, where the ability to accurately predict real estate prices directly impacts business success and customer satisfaction.

# Problem Statement

Develop a regression model that can accurately predict real estate prices based on fundamental property characteristics. The model should be robust enough to handle various property types while providing interpretable insights into which factors most significantly influence pricing decisions.

# Target Variable

**Real Estate Price**: The final sale or rental price of the property (in thousands of dollars). This represents the actual market value achieved through transactions, making it the most reliable indicator of property worth. Accurate price prediction is crucial for real estate businesses as it directly impacts revenue, customer trust, and market competitiveness. The ability to predict prices enables automated valuations, portfolio assessments, and informed investment decisions.

# Predictor Variables

- **Square Footage**: Total livable area of the property in square feet. This is typically the strongest predictor of property value, as larger spaces generally command higher prices and represent the fundamental utility of the property.

- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the property. This categorical-like variable affects both the property's functionality and target market, with family-oriented buyers often prioritizing bedroom count for space planning and future needs.

- **Location Score**: A composite metric (1-100 scale) evaluating neighborhood desirability based on factors like school quality, crime rates, proximity to amenities, and transportation access. Location is often cited as the most critical factor in real estate valuation.

- **Age**: Age of the property in years since construction. Newer properties may command premium prices due to modern amenities and lower maintenance needs, while older properties might offer character but require renovation considerations.

- **Amenities Count**: Total number of premium features such as swimming pools, fitness centers, parking spaces, balconies, or smart home systems. These value-added features can significantly differentiate properties in competitive markets.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds004_business_real_estate_price.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental regression techniques without data preprocessing complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds004_business_real_estate_price_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues that require preprocessing, imputation strategies, and outlier detection methods

# Suggested Approaches

- **Linear Regression**: Start with multiple linear regression to establish baseline performance and understand feature relationships. This approach provides excellent interpretability for business stakeholders.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Implement ensemble methods to capture non-linear relationships between features and handle feature interactions automatically, while maintaining reasonable interpretability through feature importance scores.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Deploy advanced boosting algorithms for potentially superior predictive performance, especially useful when dealing with complex feature interactions and when prediction accuracy is prioritized over interpretability.
