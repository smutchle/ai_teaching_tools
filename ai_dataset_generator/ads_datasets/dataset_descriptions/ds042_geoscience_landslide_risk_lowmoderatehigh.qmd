# Background and Use Case

Following a series of devastating landslides in mountainous regions that resulted in significant infrastructure damage and evacuation orders, the Regional Geological Survey has initiated a comprehensive terrain stability assessment program. The agency needs to develop a systematic approach to classify landslide risk across thousands of locations to prioritize monitoring efforts, inform land-use planning decisions, and establish early warning systems for vulnerable communities.

Traditional geological surveys are time-consuming and expensive, often taking months to assess individual sites. By developing a predictive model using readily available environmental and geological data, the survey team can rapidly screen large areas and focus their detailed field investigations on the highest-risk locations. This approach would enable more efficient resource allocation and potentially save lives by identifying dangerous areas before catastrophic events occur.

The dataset represents measurements collected from 500,000 diverse terrain locations across various geological settings, from stable plains to steep mountain slopes. Each location has been carefully assessed by expert geologists and classified into risk categories based on comprehensive field investigations, providing ground truth labels for model development.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a reliable classification system that can predict landslide risk levels (Low, Moderate, or High) based on measurable environmental and geological characteristics. This multi-class classification problem requires understanding the complex interactions between topographical, geological, ecological, and climatic factors that contribute to slope stability.

# Target Variable

**Landslide Risk (Low/Moderate/High)**: This ordinal categorical variable represents the assessed probability and potential severity of landslide occurrence at each location. 

- **Low Risk**: Stable terrain with minimal likelihood of slope failure, suitable for most development activities
- **Moderate Risk**: Areas with some instability factors present, requiring monitoring and potentially restricted land use
- **High Risk**: Locations with significant landslide potential, requiring immediate attention, possible evacuation planning, or development restrictions

Accurate prediction of this variable is crucial for public safety, infrastructure planning, and environmental management. It enables authorities to make informed decisions about construction permits, emergency preparedness, and resource allocation for monitoring systems.

# Predictor Variables

- **Slope**: The angle of terrain inclination measured in degrees. Steeper slopes are generally more susceptible to gravitational failure, making this a primary factor in landslide risk assessment.

- **Soil Type**: Categorical variable describing the predominant soil composition (e.g., clay, sand, loam, rocky). Different soil types have varying drainage properties, cohesion, and stability characteristics that significantly influence landslide susceptibility.

- **Vegetation**: The type and density of plant cover, ranging from bare ground to dense forest. Vegetation affects slope stability through root systems that bind soil, while also influencing water infiltration and surface erosion patterns.

- **Rainfall**: Average annual precipitation in millimeters. Water is a critical trigger for landslides, as it increases soil weight, reduces friction between particles, and can create hydrostatic pressure that destabilizes slopes.

- **Seismic Activity**: A measure of earthquake frequency and intensity in the region, typically expressed as a seismic hazard index. Ground shaking can trigger landslides by overcoming the forces holding slope materials in place.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions to support different learning objectives:

- **Clean Version** (`ds042_geoscience_landslide_risk_lowmoderatehigh.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental classification techniques without data quality complications
- **Dirty Version** (`ds042_geoscience_landslide_risk_lowmoderatehigh_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues commonly encountered in environmental monitoring where equipment failures, measurement errors, or inaccessible locations can result in incomplete datasets

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Excellent for handling mixed data types (numerical and categorical) while providing feature importance insights to understand which factors most strongly influence landslide risk
- **Gradient Boosting Methods (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Well-suited for this type of environmental classification problem, with strong performance on tabular data and built-in handling of missing values
- **Logistic Regression with Ordinal Encoding**: Given the ordinal nature of the target variable (Low < Moderate < High), ordinal logistic regression can capture the natural ordering while maintaining interpretability for stakeholder communication
