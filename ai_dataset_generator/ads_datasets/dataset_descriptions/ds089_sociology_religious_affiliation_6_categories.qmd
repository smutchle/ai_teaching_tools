# Overview

This dataset explores the complex relationship between social, demographic, and geographic factors in predicting religious affiliation patterns. Using a multi-class classification approach, students can investigate how family background, education, geography, age, and social networks influence spiritual and secular identity formation in contemporary society.

# Background and Use Case

A national interfaith council is partnering with community organizations to better understand religious diversity patterns across different regions and demographics. They aim to develop more inclusive community programs and allocate resources effectively for interfaith dialogue initiatives. The council has collected comprehensive survey data from 500,000 participants across various communities to understand the factors that influence religious identity formation.

The research team wants to develop a predictive model that can help identify communities where specific religious groups might be underrepresented in interfaith programs, enabling targeted outreach efforts. This model could also assist in understanding generational shifts in religious affiliation and the role of social networks in maintaining or changing religious identity.

Additionally, sociology researchers are interested in using this model to study secularization trends and the interplay between traditional family influences and modern educational/social factors in shaping religious identity. The insights could inform academic research on religious sociology and help religious organizations adapt their community engagement strategies.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to predict an individual's religious affiliation based on their social and demographic characteristics. This multi-class classification problem requires understanding the nuanced relationships between family upbringing, geographic location, educational background, age cohort effects, and social network influences on religious identity formation.

# Target Variable

**Religious Affiliation (6 categories)**: This variable represents an individual's self-identified religious or spiritual orientation, categorized into six distinct groups: Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism/Buddhism, Other Religions, and Secular/Non-religious. This classification is particularly valuable for understanding contemporary religious landscape diversity and secularization trends. Predicting religious affiliation helps researchers and community organizations understand demographic shifts, plan inclusive programming, and study the social factors that influence spiritual identity formation in modern society.

# Predictor Variables

- **Family Background**: Captures parental religious practices, household religious traditions, and childhood religious exposure. This variable is crucial as family socialization is often the strongest predictor of religious affiliation, though its influence may vary across generations.

- **Geography**: Includes regional location, urban/rural classification, and local religious demographic composition. Geographic factors significantly influence religious affiliation through community norms, available religious institutions, and regional cultural patterns.

- **Education**: Educational attainment level and field of study. Research shows complex relationships between education and religious affiliation, with higher education sometimes associated with secularization but also with more nuanced spiritual exploration.

- **Age**: Age cohort information reflecting generational differences in religious practice and affiliation. Younger generations often show different patterns of religious identification compared to older cohorts, including higher rates of "spiritual but not religious" identification.

- **Social Networks**: Characteristics of peer groups, professional networks, and community involvement. Social networks play an increasingly important role in religious identity maintenance or change, especially as traditional family influences may weaken in modern society.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds089_sociology_religious_affiliation_6_categories.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations
- **Dirty Version** (`ds089_sociology_religious_affiliation_6_categories_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world survey data quality issues such as non-response bias and measurement errors

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Excellent for handling mixed data types and capturing complex interactions between family background, geography, and social networks while providing feature importance insights
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Effective for multi-class problems with imbalanced categories, particularly useful for identifying minority religious groups with high precision
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Provides interpretable coefficients for understanding how each predictor influences the probability of belonging to each religious category, valuable for sociological interpretation

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes in data science and sociology coursework. The relationships between variables have been designed to reflect realistic patterns found in religious sociology research while maintaining statistical complexity suitable for machine learning education. All data points are artificially generated and do not represent real individuals or communities.
