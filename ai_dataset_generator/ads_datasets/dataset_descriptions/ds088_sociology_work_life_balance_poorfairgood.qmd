# Overview

This dataset explores the critical relationship between workplace conditions and employee work-life balance satisfaction. Through analyzing key workplace factors such as work hours, commute times, job flexibility, family demands, and supervisor support, this dataset enables students to build predictive models that classify employees' work-life balance as Poor, Fair, or Good. This classification problem is particularly relevant in today's evolving work environment where organizations are increasingly focused on employee wellbeing and retention.

# Background and Use Case

The Corporate Wellness Initiative at MegaCorp, a Fortune 500 company with over 50,000 employees, has launched a comprehensive study to understand and improve employee work-life balance. Following concerning trends in employee turnover (up 23% in the past year) and declining satisfaction scores, the HR Analytics team has been tasked with identifying the key factors that contribute to work-life balance satisfaction.

The company's Chief People Officer wants to develop a predictive model that can identify employees at risk of poor work-life balance before they reach a breaking point. This proactive approach would allow HR to intervene with targeted support programs, flexible work arrangements, or management training initiatives. Additionally, the model could help inform policy decisions about remote work options, flexible scheduling, and supervisor training programs.

The dataset represents survey responses from 500,000 employees across various departments and seniority levels, collected over a six-month period. Each employee's work-life balance satisfaction was assessed through a validated psychological instrument, while workplace characteristics were gathered through both self-reporting and company records. This comprehensive approach ensures that the dataset captures both objective workplace conditions and their subjective impact on employee wellbeing.

# Problem Statement

Given an employee's workplace characteristics, can we accurately predict their work-life balance satisfaction level? This three-class classification problem aims to categorize employees into Poor, Fair, or Good work-life balance groups based on measurable workplace factors. The model should help organizations identify patterns and risk factors that contribute to work-life balance challenges.

# Target Variable

**Work-Life Balance (Poor/Fair/Good)**: This ordinal categorical variable represents an employee's overall satisfaction with their ability to balance professional responsibilities with personal life. The classification is based on a validated work-life balance scale that considers factors such as time availability for family and personal activities, stress levels, ability to disconnect from work, and overall life satisfaction.

- **Poor**: Employees experiencing significant difficulty managing work and personal responsibilities, often characterized by chronic stress, inability to disconnect from work, and neglect of personal relationships or health
- **Fair**: Employees who generally manage work and personal life adequately but may experience periodic stress or challenges in maintaining balance
- **Good**: Employees who successfully integrate work and personal life, maintaining healthy boundaries and satisfaction in both domains

This target variable is crucial for organizational psychology and human resource management, as work-life balance directly impacts employee retention, productivity, mental health, and overall organizational culture.

# Predictor Variables

1. **Work Hours**: Average weekly working hours, including overtime. This continuous variable captures the time commitment required by the job and is a primary factor in work-life balance. Higher work hours typically correlate with increased stress and reduced time for personal activities.

2. **Commute**: Daily commute time in minutes (round trip). Commuting represents "dead time" that reduces available personal time and can contribute to stress and fatigue. This variable is particularly relevant in urban environments where commute times can vary dramatically.

3. **Flexibility**: A composite score measuring job flexibility including remote work options, flexible scheduling, and autonomy over work arrangements. Higher flexibility scores indicate greater employee control over when and where work is performed, which often improves work-life balance.

4. **Family Demands**: A continuous measure of personal/family responsibilities including childcare, eldercare, and household management duties. This variable captures the "life" side of work-life balance and represents competing demands on an employee's time and energy.

5. **Supervisor Support**: A scale measuring the level of support, understanding, and accommodation provided by direct supervisors regarding work-life balance needs. This includes factors such as manager empathy, willingness to accommodate personal needs, and communication quality.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds088_sociology_work_life_balance_poorfairgood.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning, with complete data for all observations and no outliers. Perfect for students beginning their journey in classification algorithms.
- **Dirty Version** (`ds088_sociology_work_life_balance_poorfairgood_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues. This version challenges students to implement data cleaning strategies and robust modeling techniques.

# Suggested Approaches

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: Excellent for this problem due to its ability to handle mixed data types, provide feature importance rankings, and maintain good interpretability. The ensemble approach can capture complex interactions between workplace factors.

2. **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Since the target variable has a natural ordering (Poor < Fair < Good), ordinal regression can leverage this structure for potentially better performance and more meaningful probability interpretations.

3. **Gradient Boosting Methods (XGBoost, LightGBM)**: These methods excel at capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, which is common in sociological data where factors often have synergistic effects.

# Notes

This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes. The relationships between variables have been designed to reflect real-world patterns observed in organizational psychology research while maintaining clear pedagogical value. The dataset structure allows students to explore important concepts such as class imbalance handling, ordinal classification, feature engineering, and the interpretation of sociological data patterns. Students are encouraged to consider the ethical implications of using such models in real workplace settings, including privacy concerns and potential algorithmic bias.
