# Background and Use Case

Dr. Sarah Chen's biochemistry lab at the university is developing a new therapeutic enzyme for treating metabolic disorders. The enzyme shows promise in preliminary studies, but optimizing its activity under different physiological conditions is crucial for drug development. Traditional trial-and-error approaches to enzyme optimization are time-consuming and expensive, often requiring hundreds of individual experiments.

The lab has collected extensive data on how various factors affect the enzyme's catalytic performance. Temperature fluctuations mimic different body conditions, pH variations simulate different tissue environments, and substrate concentrations reflect varying nutrient levels in patients. Additionally, the presence of natural inhibitors and essential cofactors significantly impacts enzyme function.

By building predictive models from this data, the research team can identify optimal conditions for maximum enzyme activity, accelerate the drug development process, and reduce experimental costs. This approach represents a shift toward data-driven biochemistry, where machine learning guides experimental design and therapeutic optimization.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to predict enzyme activity (measured in micromoles of product formed per minute) based on experimental conditions. Accurate predictions will enable researchers to optimize reaction conditions, understand enzyme kinetics, and design more effective therapeutic interventions without exhaustive experimental testing.

# Target Variable

**Enzyme Activity**: Measured in micromoles per minute (μmol/min), this represents the rate at which the enzyme converts substrate molecules into products. This is a fundamental measure of enzymatic efficiency and directly correlates with therapeutic effectiveness. Higher activity values indicate better enzyme performance, which translates to more effective treatment outcomes. Understanding and predicting enzyme activity is crucial for drug dosage calculations, treatment protocols, and assessing therapeutic viability under different physiological conditions.

# Predictor Variables

- **Temperature**: Measured in degrees Celsius (°C). Enzyme activity is highly temperature-dependent due to protein structure sensitivity. Higher temperatures generally increase reaction rates until the enzyme denatures, creating a complex non-linear relationship.

- **pH**: The acidity/alkalinity of the reaction environment (scale 0-14). Each enzyme has an optimal pH range where its active site maintains the proper shape for substrate binding. Deviations can dramatically reduce activity.

- **Substrate Concentration**: Measured in millimolar (mM). Following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enzyme activity increases with substrate concentration until saturation occurs, creating a characteristic curve relationship.

- **Inhibitor Presence**: Binary variable (0/1) indicating whether competitive or non-competitive inhibitors are present in the reaction mixture. Inhibitors can significantly reduce enzyme activity by blocking active sites or altering enzyme shape.

- **Cofactors**: Measured in micromolar (μM) concentration. Many enzymes require cofactors (metal ions, vitamins, or other molecules) to function properly. Insufficient cofactor levels can severely limit enzyme activity regardless of other optimal conditions.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds023_biology_enzyme_activity.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core regression concepts. Contains complete data with realistic but clean measurements suitable for straightforward analysis.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds023_biology_enzyme_activity_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world laboratory conditions where equipment malfunctions, measurement errors, and experimental complications create data quality challenges. Perfect for practicing data cleaning and robust modeling techniques.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest Regression**: Excellent for capturing non-linear relationships between enzyme activity and multiple environmental factors, while providing feature importance rankings to identify key variables.

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Effective for modeling the complex kinetic relationships in enzyme systems, particularly useful when dealing with the non-linear saturation effects of substrate concentration.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Powerful for handling the interactive effects between variables (e.g., temperature-pH interactions) and can achieve high prediction accuracy for enzyme activity optimization.
