title: "Dataset 26: Customer Churn Prediction for TechServe Solutions"
format: html
---

# Overview

This dataset contains customer behavioral and service data from TechServe Solutions, a mid-sized B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) company. The goal is to predict customer churn using key indicators such as contract terms, support interactions, product usage patterns, and payment history. This classification problem represents one of the most critical challenges in modern business analytics, where identifying at-risk customers can significantly impact company revenue and growth strategies.

# Background and Use Case

TechServe Solutions provides cloud-based project management software to small and medium enterprises across North America. Like many SaaS companies, they operate on a subscription model where customer retention is crucial for sustainable growth. The company's customer success team has noticed increasing churn rates over the past year, particularly among certain customer segments, prompting the need for a predictive model to identify at-risk accounts.

The customer success team currently relies on manual reviews and intuition to identify customers who might cancel their subscriptions. However, with over 10,000 active accounts and limited staff, this approach is neither scalable nor consistently effective. By implementing a data-driven churn prediction model, TechServe can proactively engage with at-risk customers, potentially saving hundreds of thousands in annual recurring revenue.

The company has collected historical data on customer behavior, service interactions, and account characteristics for customers who either churned or remained active over the past 18 months. This dataset represents a carefully curated sample that captures the key patterns observed in their customer base, making it ideal for developing and testing predictive models.

# Problem Statement

Develop a binary classification model to predict whether a customer will churn (cancel their subscription) based on their contract terms, support history, usage patterns, and payment behavior. The model should help the customer success team prioritize their retention efforts and implement targeted interventions to reduce churn rates.

# Target Variable

**Customer Churn (Yes/No)**: A binary indicator of whether a customer canceled their subscription within the observation period. "Yes" indicates the customer churned (canceled their service), while "No" indicates they remained an active subscriber. This is a critical business metric because acquiring new customers typically costs 5-25 times more than retaining existing ones. Accurate churn prediction enables proactive customer success interventions, personalized retention campaigns, and strategic resource allocation to maximize customer lifetime value.

# Predictor Variables

- **Contract Length**: The duration of the customer's service contract (in months). Shorter contracts may indicate lower commitment levels and higher churn risk, while longer contracts suggest stronger customer relationships but may also reflect customers who are locked in despite dissatisfaction.

- **Support Tickets**: The number of customer support tickets submitted during the observation period. This variable captures customer satisfaction and product experience - moderate ticket counts might indicate engaged users seeking help, while very high counts could signal frustration and churn risk.

- **Usage Frequency**: A measure of how actively the customer uses the software platform (sessions per week). Low usage often precedes churn as it indicates declining engagement or value realization, while consistent high usage typically correlates with customer satisfaction and retention.

- **Payment Delays**: The number of times a customer's payment was late or required follow-up during the contract period. Payment delays can indicate financial stress, administrative issues, or declining prioritization of the service, all of which are strong predictors of churn risk.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds026_business_customer_churn_yesno.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning core concepts. Contains complete data with no missing values or outliers, allowing students to focus on algorithm implementation and interpretation.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds026_business_customer_churn_yesno_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues. Perfect for practicing data preprocessing, handling missing data, and building robust models that perform well with imperfect data.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Logistic Regression**: An excellent starting point for binary classification problems, providing interpretable coefficients that help explain which factors most strongly influence churn decisions. The probability outputs are particularly valuable for ranking customer risk levels.

- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method that handles mixed data types well and provides feature importance rankings. Particularly effective for this domain as it can capture non-linear relationships between usage patterns and churn while being relatively resistant to outliers.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Advanced ensemble techniques that often achieve superior predictive performance in business applications. These methods can capture complex interactions between contract terms, usage patterns, and support history that simpler models might miss.
