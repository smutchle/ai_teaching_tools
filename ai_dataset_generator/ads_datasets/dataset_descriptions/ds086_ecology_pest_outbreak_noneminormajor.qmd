# Background and Use Case

The Regional Agricultural Extension Service has been monitoring pest populations across 50 farming districts over multiple growing seasons. With climate change altering traditional pest cycles and increasing pressure to reduce pesticide use, farmers and agricultural advisors need better tools to anticipate pest outbreaks before they cause significant crop damage.

Consider Sarah Martinez, an agricultural extension agent working with organic vegetable farmers in the Central Valley. Each spring, she helps farmers make critical decisions about pest management strategies. Should they release beneficial insects early in the season? Is the risk high enough to justify organic pesticide applications? With limited resources and environmental concerns, these decisions can make the difference between a profitable harvest and devastating crop losses.

Traditional pest monitoring relies heavily on visual field surveys and historical patterns, but these methods often detect problems too late for effective intervention. By leveraging machine learning on ecological monitoring data, extension services can provide farmers with early warning systems that consider multiple environmental and biological factors simultaneously, enabling proactive rather than reactive pest management.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the severity level of pest outbreaks (None, Minor, or Major) based on environmental and ecological indicators. This multi-class classification problem helps agricultural stakeholders anticipate pest pressure and implement appropriate management strategies before significant crop damage occurs.

# Target Variable

**Pest Outbreak (None/Minor/Major)**: This ordinal categorical variable represents the severity of pest infestations observed during peak growing season:

- **None**: Pest populations remain below economic threshold levels, requiring no intervention
- **Minor**: Pest populations reach levels that may cause some crop damage but can be managed with minimal intervention (beneficial insects, targeted treatments)
- **Major**: Pest populations exceed economic thresholds and require immediate, intensive management to prevent significant crop losses

Accurately predicting outbreak severity allows farmers to optimize resource allocation, minimize unnecessary pesticide applications, and implement preventive measures when conditions favor pest development.

# Predictor Variables

- **Temperature**: Average daily temperature (°C) during the critical early growing period. Higher temperatures often accelerate pest reproduction cycles and can stress plants, making them more susceptible to damage. Temperature also influences the effectiveness of natural enemies and pesticide applications.

- **Host Density**: Measure of crop plant density and uniformity in the agricultural area. Higher host density can support larger pest populations, while diverse plantings may disrupt pest establishment. This variable captures both the availability of food sources for pests and the structural complexity of the agricultural landscape.

- **Natural Enemy Abundance**: Population index of beneficial insects and other natural pest control agents (predators, parasitoids, pathogens). Higher natural enemy populations typically suppress pest outbreaks through biological control. This variable reflects the health of the local ecosystem and the effectiveness of conservation biological control practices.

- **Pesticide History**: Categorical or indexed measure of recent pesticide application intensity in the area. Heavy pesticide use can disrupt natural enemy populations, potentially leading to pest resurgence or secondary pest outbreaks. This variable also captures the potential for pesticide resistance development in pest populations.

# Dataset Versions

This dataset is provided in two versions:

- **Clean Version** (`ds086_ecology_pest_outbreak_noneminormajor.csv`): Ideal for initial model development and learning fundamental classification techniques. Contains complete data with realistic but clean relationships between variables.

- **Dirty Version** (`ds086_ecology_pest_outbreak_noneminormajor_dirty.csv`): Contains 2% missing values and 1% outliers, simulating real-world data quality issues such as sensor malfunctions, incomplete field surveys, and data entry errors. Perfect for practicing data preprocessing and robust modeling techniques.

# Suggested Approaches

- **Random Forest**: Excellent for capturing non-linear interactions between ecological variables and handling mixed data types. The ensemble approach is robust to outliers and provides feature importance rankings to identify key pest outbreak predictors.

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Particularly effective for this ordinal classification problem, as boosting can capture the subtle differences between outbreak severity levels. These methods excel at handling complex ecological relationships and can incorporate domain knowledge through custom loss functions.

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Since the target variable has a natural ordering (None < Minor < Major), ordinal regression can leverage this structure for improved predictions while maintaining interpretability for agricultural extension agents.
